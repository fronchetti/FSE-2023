# Meeting Report (19/02)
Participants: Christoph, Steinmacher, Wiese, Gustavo and Felipe.

In this meeting we decided the next steps to proceed with the documentation files classification.
We are looking for information in CONTRIBUTING and README files related to the onboarding process of newcomers in OSS projects.

We stablished a sequence of four steps as future work:

1) Define the categories we want to predict:
We will review the Barriers Model and define the categories we want to identify in documentation files.
Since some barriers are not related to documentation files (e.g. Shyness), we will consider as categories only barriers that
can be textually described in a documentation file (e.g. How to submit a pull request).

2) Write a tutorial on how to (qualitatively) code the documentation files:
With the categories defined, we will write a tutorial on how to identify the categories in README and CONTRIBUTING files.
This tutorial will guide future qualitative analyzes. The idea is to describe each category giving examples from OSS projects already qualified.

3) Conduct a pilot analysis:
Steinmacher, Wiese, Christoph, Gustavo and Felipe, using the tutorial described in step two, will code the documentation files.
They will also describe, for each category, where and why they used the category. At the end, we will calculate the agreement using IRR, and if we find 
a satisfatory result, we will proceed to the next step. 

4) Conduct the analysis with undergraduate students:
Students from UFPA (Gustavo's University) and USP (Felipe's University) will execute the same codification made in step three.
They will follow our tutorial, and will code a set of OSS projects. The codes will be analyzed by the researchers, and then be used
as samples in the machine learning algorithm.

5) Apply natural language processing techniques to predict categories:
With a training set containing samples manually classified by the students, we will make use of techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically identify the categories in a test set. The machine learning algorithm will learn with the samples, and will try to identify the same categories in new documentation files.

6) Validate the results: <br>
   We intend to validate the results using two different approaches:<br>
    i) Use students to evaluate the quality of the prediction:<br>
        We will ask students in a survey if they agree with the categories the algorithm predicted.<br>
        (e.g. "Is this paragraph related to the pull requests submission process?")<br>
    ii) Use students to select the best documentation:<br>
        We will identify the categories in documentation files and reorganize the categories into a new documentation file.<br>
        We will ask students which documentation file they prefer, the original or the reorganized one.<br>
