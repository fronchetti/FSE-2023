## STEP 4 (Part II: USP)
### Conduct the analysis with undergraduate students:
In April, we applied the experiment with undergraduate students from the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
The tutorial used during the experiment was an updated version of the last tutorial containing observations by Gustavo of the experiment at UFPA.

Experiment Tutorial:
* English: https://fronchetti.com.br/ICSE-2019/
* Portuguese: https://fronchetti.com.br/ICSE-2019/index-pt.html

You can find a copy of the analysis made by each student at [this folder](https://github.com/fronchetti/ICSE-2019/tree/master/april-report/analysis/usp). To preserve the privacy of the students, their names (and any other private information) were not saved after the experiment. One student during the submission of the experiment, pointed out an interesting observation:

>"Very nice experiment, it is clear that there are a lot of open source projects that do not contain information on how to contribute, which makes the contribution process difficult to understand."

### Comparision of the analysis made by USP and UFPA students:<br>

#### UFPA

It is easy to see that there are some patterns among the categories. Our next step is to apply the data given by the students into a machine learning classifer.
A meeting will be scheduled for the next week.
