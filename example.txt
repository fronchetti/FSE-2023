Text = We maintain up to three stable branches at once (the current release plus two LTS branches). To get a fix into one of those branches, first get accepted into master, as described above. Fixes are merged into master and then merged backwards into stable releases as appropriate.

Text = Please add appropriate test cases as you make changes, and make sure that they pass locally before submitting your pull request; see here for more information.  All the tests are run via Phabricator, however testing locally greatly speeds up the process of accepting your changes.

Text = We'd love to have your help in making HHVM better. Before jumping into the code, please familiarize yourself with our coding conventions. We're also working on a Hacker's Guide to HHVM. It's still very incomplete, but if there's a specific topic you'd like to see addressed sooner rather than later, let us know. For documentation and any other problems, 
please open an issue, or better yet, fork us and send a pull request. Join us on Freenode in #hhvm for general discussion, or #hhvm-dev for development-oriented discussion.

Text = Bug reports will be closed if the issue has been inactive and the latest affected version no longer receives support. At the moment, Electron maintains its three latest major versions, with a new major version being released every 12 weeks. (For more information on Electron's release cadence, see this blog post.)

Text = Then, submit another PR against the relevant stable branch(es) cherry-picking your change into that branch, with any changes needed to properly backport. Make sure to explain in the PR summary why the change should be considered for inclusion in the stable branch -- basically, make the case for why the issue the change is fixing is worse than the possible risk of what the change might break (and thus what we will be responsible for debugging, fixing, and maintaining).

Text = We accept issues in any language.
When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply.
Anyone may post the translated reply.
In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient.
Having the original text as well as the translation can help mitigate translation errors.
