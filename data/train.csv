"The Tracker is a piece of Software which listens for HttpRequests. Each Request can either be an Announce
or Scrape request. Therefore the Tracker needs code which handles HttpRequests. The Tracker was programmed
in such a way that it is independent of the http handling code. The http handling code is called Frontend.
There are currently two Frontends implemented. The first uses the class HttpListener. This implementation
got most attention. The second one uses the Asp.Net infrastructe and the HttpHandles classes. It therefore
could be used in xsp2, mod_mono or even in IIS. But the second implementation was just a proof of concept
and is not tested but should be functional. There exists and Frontend directory which contains all the
Frontend handling code.",CF – Contribution flow

"The goal is to make the common use-cases exposed via simple controls on UI while allowing further customizations to be done through hooks and scripts. If a new feature is doable via the existing features, or a basic tool, do not add it to CapRover. We do not want to bloat this application. One example is: ""Add a flag to customize the placement constraints of containers"". This is definitely doable in Docker, but we don't want to mirror every single functionality of Docker to CapRover. If we do that, CapRover becomes a very hard to maintain project. Instead we should add customization hooks for these advanced and rare use cases. For example, instead of mirroring every single nginx config, we added the ability of customizing the nginx config for advanced users.- Last but not least AVOID LARGE PULL REQUESTS at all cost as they won't get reviewed unless they are discussed in the Slack channel beforehand.",No categories identified.

"We use a dummy project called ApiCompat to enforce API compatibility between the GA'ed libraries and the most recent version available on Nuget. This project includes package references to the GA'ed library and to Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.
Each library needs to provide a ApiCompatVersion property which is set to the last GA'ed version of the library which is used to compare APIs with the current to ensure no breaks
have been introduced.
The ApiCompatVerification target defined in ApiCompat.csproj is referenced in the eng/Directory.Build.Data.targets which causes this target to be executed for each csproj that has the ApiCompatVersion property set. For libraries that wish to disable the APICompat check they can remove the ApiCompatVersion property from their project. Our version bump automation will automatically add or increment the ApiCompatVersion property to the project when it detects that the version it is changing was a GA version which usually indicates that we just shipped that GA version and so it should be the new baseline for api checks.",No categories identified.

We periodically ""sync"" translation.io with the development version of the

Sync'ing loads the updated English text config/locales/en.yml

When this updated version of the badge application is later
put into production, the updated translations are used.
This makes it very easy for translators to translate text.

"Where reasonable, limit yourself to Markdown

the version of Markdown implemented by GitHub when it renders .md files,

This version of markdown is sometimes called
GitHub-flavored markdown.
In particular, blank lines separate paragraphs; newlines inside a paragraph
do not force a line break.
Beware - this is not
the same markdown algorithm used by GitHub when it renders

newlines in paragraph-like content are considered as real line breaks;
unfortunately this other algorithm is also called
