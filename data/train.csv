"We use a dummy project called ApiCompat to enforce API compatibility between the GA'ed libraries and the most recent version available on Nuget. This project includes package references to the GA'ed library and to Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.
Each library needs to provide a ApiCompatVersion property which is set to the last GA'ed version of the library which is used to compare APIs with the current to ensure no breaks
have been introduced.
The ApiCompatVerification target defined in ApiCompat.csproj is referenced in the eng/Directory.Build.Data.targets which causes this target to be executed for each csproj that has the ApiCompatVersion property set. For libraries that wish to disable the APICompat check they can remove the ApiCompatVersion property from their project. Our version bump automation will automatically add or increment the ApiCompatVersion property to the project when it detects that the version it is changing was a GA version which usually indicates that we just shipped that GA version and so it should be the new baseline for api checks.",No categories identified.

prefer symbols over strings (especially as hash keys)

Symbols are typically faster, with no loss of readability.

Data from JSON should normally be accessed with strings,
since that's how Ruby normally reads it.
Rails normally uses the type ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess,
where the difference between symbols and strings is ignored,

considered different; be careful to use the correct type in these cases.",DC – Deal with the code

"Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.",DC – Deal with the code

"Where reasonable, limit yourself to Markdown
that will be accepted by different markdown processors
(e.g., what is specified by CommonMark or the original Markdown)
In practice we use
the version of Markdown implemented by GitHub when it renders .md files,
and you can use its extensions
(in particular, mark code snippets with the programming language used).
This version of markdown is sometimes called
GitHub-flavored markdown.
In particular, blank lines separate paragraphs; newlines inside a paragraph
do not force a line break.
Beware - this is not
the same markdown algorithm used by GitHub when it renders
issue or pull comments; in those cases
newlines in paragraph-like content are considered as real line breaks;
unfortunately this other algorithm is also called
GitHub rendered markdown.

"Mike Perham's Kill Your Dependencies
notes that, ""every dependency in your application has the potential to
bloat your app, to destabilize your app, to inject odd behavior...
When you are considering adding a dependency to your Rails app,
it's a good idea to do a quick sanity check..."".
So don't bring in gems you don't need
(if it's trivial to re-implement the required function, consider doing it).
Also, if the gem transitively depends on in many other gems,
especially if they are new additions, look for simpler alternatives
or help the upstream library remove the unnecessary dependencies.",No categories identified.

"It's important to try to stay relatively up to date.
However, it's usually not possible to keep
everything perfectly up-to-date, because
different gems' specifications forbid it.
Also, the Ruby ecosystem is fairly fast-moving,
so it doesn't take long at all for even a direct dependency to go out of date.
In short, it's normal to have some gems that are not the latest.
The key is to replace gem versions that have security vulnerabilities,
and to not get too far behind, because if it's too far back then it's
harder to update.
If you are very far behind, it may be better to update in stages

nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your
contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change

that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting

"The goal is to make the common use-cases exposed via simple controls on UI while allowing further customizations to be done through hooks and scripts. If a new feature is doable via the existing features, or a basic tool, do not add it to CapRover. We do not want to bloat this application. One example is: ""Add a flag to customize the placement constraints of containers"". This is definitely doable in Docker, but we don't want to mirror every single functionality of Docker to CapRover. If we do that, CapRover becomes a very hard to maintain project. Instead we should add customization hooks for these advanced and rare use cases. For example, instead of mirroring every single nginx config, we added the ability of customizing the nginx config for advanced users.- Last but not least AVOID LARGE PULL REQUESTS at all cost as they won't get reviewed unless they are discussed in the Slack channel beforehand.",No categories identified.

"Please use an email system (like Gmail) that supports
hop-to-hop encryption using STARTTLS when reporting vulnerabilities.
Examples of such systems include Gmail, Outlook.com, and runbox.com.
See STARTTLS Everywhere

Your email client should use encryption to communicate with
your email system (i.e., if you use a web-based email client then use HTTPS,

Hop-to-hop encryption isn't as strong as end-to-end encryption,

"We prefer very small, descriptive functions over long monolythic functions. Try to keep your functions to something around 4-9 lines. If your functions are longer than 9 lines, it probably is a good chance for breaking it into smaller local private methods or turning what is being processed into a class and handling the logic more inside of there.
