"We'd love to have your help in making HHVM better. Before jumping into the code, please familiarize yourself with our coding conventions. We're also working on a Hacker's Guide to HHVM. It's still very incomplete, but if there's a specific topic you'd like to see addressed sooner rather than later, let us know. For documentation and any other problems, please open an issue, or better yet, fork us and send a pull request. Join us on Freenode in #hhvm for general discussion, or #hhvm-dev for development-oriented discussion.",No categories identified.

Make sure to explain in the PR summary why the change should be considered for inclusion in the stable branch -- basically, make the case for why the issue the change is fixing is worse than the possible risk of what the change might break (and thus what we will be responsible for debugging, fixing, and maintaining).",No categories identified.
