"Here's how we handle translations.
We periodically ""sync"" translation.io with the development version of the
badge application using the command rake translation:sync.
Sync'ing loads the updated English text config/locales/en.yml
to the translation.io website,
and also copies the translations in the translation.io website
into the badge application directory config/locales/.
When this updated version of the badge application is later
put into production, the updated translations are used.
This makes it very easy for translators to translate text.
Note that there are intermediate steps between the updating a translation
and deployment to users, so there's a delay between editing the translation
and seeing it deployed.",No categories identified.

any possible usage, else we would have to publish a major release for each change and it would no longer make sense.",No categories identified.

"Do not modify a String literal in-place
(e.g., using ""<<"", ""sub!"", or ""gsub!"") until you have applied "".dup"" to it.
There are current plans that
Ruby 3's string literals will be immutable.
See issue 11473 for more.
Even if this doesn't happen, freezing string literals is both faster and
reduces the risk of accidentally modifying a shared string.
Use ""dup"" on a string literal to produce a mutable string;
since ""dup"" is already permitted in the language,
this provides a simple backwards-compatible way for us to indicate
that the String is mutable in this case.
For example, if you want to build a string using append, do this:",DC – Deal with the code
