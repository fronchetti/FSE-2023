"As a developer, you must understand every change is a breaking change. What is a bug for someone

Semantic Versioning relies to public API. In PHP, the public API of a class is its public
methods. However, if you extend a class, you can access protected methods, then if you use reflexion, you can
access private methods. So anything can become a public API if you force it to be. That doesn't mean we should handle
any possible usage, else we would have to publish a major release for each change and it would no longer make sense.",No categories identified.

"It's important to try to stay relatively up to date.
However, it's usually not possible to keep
everything perfectly up-to-date, because
different gems' specifications forbid it.
Also, the Ruby ecosystem is fairly fast-moving,
so it doesn't take long at all for even a direct dependency to go out of date.
In short, it's normal to have some gems that are not the latest.
The key is to replace gem versions that have security vulnerabilities,
and to not get too far behind, because if it's too far back then it's
harder to update.
If you are very far behind, it may be better to update in stages

"Do not modify a String literal in-place
(e.g., using ""<<"", ""sub!"", or ""gsub!"") until you have applied "".dup"" to it.
There are current plans that
Ruby 3's string literals will be immutable.
See issue 11473 for more.
Even if this doesn't happen, freezing string literals is both faster and
reduces the risk of accidentally modifying a shared string.
Use ""dup"" on a string literal to produce a mutable string;
since ""dup"" is already permitted in the language,
this provides a simple backwards-compatible way for us to indicate
that the String is mutable in this case.
For example, if you want to build a string using append, do this:",DC – Deal with the code

Chart parameters are stored as a JSON encoded string the slices.params column and are often referenced throughout the code as form-data. Currently the form-data is neither versioned nor typed as thus is somewhat free-formed. Note in the future there may be merit in using something like JSON Schema to both annotate and validate the JSON object in addition to using a Mypy TypedDict (introduced in Python 3.8) for typing the form-data in the backend. This section serves as a potential primer for that work.,No categories identified.
