__label__bw Many of the NPM scripts used during development use commands designed for a Linux-like shell.If you are running a Windows operating system, you may encounter many commands that are not working. To fix this behavior, you have to set a Linux-like shell as the default npm script shell. If you have Git for Windows installed, you can set Git Bash as the default script shell by using the following command:

__label__cf Weekly design reviews
__label__no ## Example
__label__sc It's welcomed to pull request. And there are some tips about that:
__label__sc You should describe what Github issue or ticket that the PR is associated withto assist the review process. If this PR is resolving a particular bug, atesting strategy should be described in the testing section. If this PR iscontributing a new feature, a description should describe a scenario to test orverify the new functionality.
__label__cf - Once you get a nod from one of the Cake Team, you can start on the feature.
__label__sc - Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows ourcommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventionsis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
__label__no Examples of documentation:
__label__dc or similar as the later will cause typing issues. The former is of type List[Callable] whereas the later is of type Optional[List[Callable]].

__label__no Where changes to an existing interface are necessary, functions in the public interface which need to be changed, are marked as 'deprecated'. This is done with the preprocessor symbols MBEDTLS_DEPRECATED_WARNING and MBEDTLS_DEPRECATED_REMOVED. Then, a new function with a new name but similar if not identical behaviour to the original function containing the necessary changes should be created alongside the existing deprecated function.
__label__no Please search the existing issues to see if any similar issue or feature request has already been filed. You should make sure your issue isn't redundant.

__label__no Bug Reports
__label__no - Pull request at Github
__label__sc The pull request process differs for new features and bugs. Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title. The proposal should describe the new feature, as well as implementation ideas. The proposal will then be reviewed and either approved or denied. Once a proposal is approved, a pull request may be created implementing the new feature. Pull requests which do not follow this guideline will be closed immediately.
__label__no - Updating documentation

__label__dc - Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
__label__no As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. Assuming the change does not affect functionality, some common obvious fix examples include the following:
__label__no Similar to defining an interface or a struct definition, GraphQL has flexibletypes that can be used to define data types that are used for querying data fromthe API.

__label__no bootstrap_form needs a few models and tables to support testing. It appears that the necessary tables were created via the demo/db/schema.rb file. To support rich_text_area, Rails 6 creates some migrations. These migrations had to be run in the existing database (not an empty one) to create a new schema.rb that creates the bootstrap_form test tables, and the tables needed by Rails 6. The schema.rb file was checked in to GitHub, but the migrations were not.

__label__bw Now that you've chosen how you want to submit a patch, you need to get thesource code.
__label__sc You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do itagain.
__label__cf - Send a pull request.
__label__no - [ ] Try to remove as much vendor dependencies as possible
__label__sc - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):
__label__no Otherwise, do you:

__label__no Also, your proposed solution may not be compatible with the direction we want to take the product, but we may be able to come up with another solution which has approximately the same effect and does fit into the product direction.
__label__dc None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.
__label__dc $ npm run dev:server
__label__no Contribution Steps:
__label__no - If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
__label__sc Pull Request Template
__label__cf To get started with the project, run yarn bootstrap in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:
__label__bw Then, run:
__label__dc - You may use a simple (throw) statement in case of enforcing contracts on argument
__label__sc - All new features will be added into master or next branch as well as all bug-fix except security issues. In such way, we can motivate developers to update to the latest stable version.
__label__dc yarn build: run build for all component packages
__label__no Example: Creating API endpoints require 24 steps, most of which are boilerplate and repetitive.
__label__no Extra points if the test code can be automated and added to the test suite.
__label__sc The summary must be on a line of its own, with a "ChangeLog:" prefix at thebeginning of the line. The text should start with "Foo plugin" to give thereader context for the information. Other common contexts are "collectd" forthe core daemon, "Build system", and "Documentation". Use past tense andpassive voice the for remainder, e.g. "a bug has been fixed", "a feature hasbeen added".

__label__tc This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
__label__sc - Check out the master branch:
__label__cf - Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
__label__cf - Push your branch to GitHub:
__label__no Getting started
__label__cf Install all npm scripts:
__label__sc - Make your feature addition or bug fix.
__label__no Please do not submit reports related to wayland, seehere for moreinformation.
__label__dc - When an object doesn't have clear copy semantics (ex. a system resource or gl::Texture, inherit from ci::Noncopyable so it is obvious that the object cannot be copied.
__label__no - If the documentation is about a currently available feature in cmder or correcting already created documentation, you can safely make your changes on the master branch and pull request them onto master.
__label__no - Automated Tests
__label__sc yarn test -u
__label__no - @64 took the time to test the pre-released 0.6.0 version and submit PR #25, fixing a silent error and some warnings.
__label__dc - Install Abbreviation Plugin.
__label__no Thanks you for your interest in contributing to Acr.UserDIalogs - Please see our our Code of Conduct.
__label__dc - General GitHub documentation
__label__no Reporting an Issue
__label__no Did you find a bug?
__label__sc nosetests suppresses stdout by default. To see stdout, pass the -s flagto nosetests.
__label__cf Reviewing large pull requests can take a lot of time. Time that may not always be available. Smaller pull requests may land more quickly. If you're introducing a new feature think about how it might be broken up. It's OK to land features as opt-in experiments. These require less documentation and test coverage.

__label__no Contributing
__label__no Contributing Guidelines
__label__ct Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
__label__no - It is very hard to keep the project in good health in terms of technical debt, usability, serviceability, etc. If the proposed feature isnot clearly stated, enough information is not provided or it is not sure that would be a good feature for the future development of the project, it won't be accepted. The community plays a very important role during this discussion so it strongly encouraged toexplain the value of a feature for the community, the needed documentation and its use cases.
__label__sc git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
__label__sc For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure thatcontributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given toweekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time tobecome involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.
__label__sc How to check proposed changes before submitting them
__label__sc Scope
__label__sc It is important to note that we use the git commit messages to generate the AngularJS MaterialCHANGELOG document. Improperly formatted commit messages may result in yourchange not appearing in the CHANGELOG of the next release.
__label__no - Want to report a Bug?
__label__sc The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For examplemenu, sidebar, etc.
__label__sc When addressing review comments in a MR, please do not rebase/squash thecommits immediately. Doing so makes it harder to review the new changes,slowing down the process of merging a MR. Instead, when addressing reviewcomments, you should append new commits to the branch and only squashthem into other commits when the MR is ready to be merged. We recommendcreating new commits with git commit --fixup (or --squash) and thenlater squashing them with git rebase --autosquash to make things easier.
__label__no - Initial Setup
__label__cf If your pull request shows conflicts with master, merge master into your feature branch:
__label__sc Bug fixes: If you

__label__dc libui uses camel-case for naming, with a handful of very specific exceptions (namely GObject method names, where GObject itself enforces the naming convention).
__label__no Thanks for considering to write a Pull Request (PR) for CLI11! Here are a few guidelines to get you started:
__label__cf - [ ] Add @babel/syntax-new-syntax package. You can copy packages/babel-plugin-syntax-decimal and replace decimal to new-syntax.
__label__bw To update all dependencies (without bumping major versions):
__label__sc 3.  Make sure that bundle exec rake test:js pass
__label__sc Run tests
__label__no If you find a bug, please report it, including environment and examples of current behavior and what you believe to be the correct behavior.  The clearer your description and information, the more likely it is someone will be able to make progress on it.  The default issue template will help guide you through this.
__label__cf Whether it's fixing Bugs or adding Features, we're all very welcome. If you want to submit code to Doris, you need to create a new branch for your submitted code from the fork code library on GitHub to your project space, add the source project upstream, and submit PR.
__label__dc - Each line of code should only include a single statement.
__label__no We typically follow these two rules in commenting our GraphQL types:

__label__cf Project organization
__label__no - Keep tickets short but sweet. Make sure you include all the context needed to solve the issue. Don't overdo it. Great tickets allow us to focus on solving problems instead of discussing them.
__label__sc - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
__label__no Use the scope:documentation label to find suggestions for what we'd love to see more documentation on.
__label__no 3.  What did you expect to see?
__label__no - Varvy PageSpeed

__label__no We like to encourage you to contribute to the Chai.js repository. This should be as easy as possible for you but there are a few things to consider when contributing. The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request or open an issue.
__label__tc Code of Conduct
__label__sc - If the commit is about documentation, the message should be prefixed with (doc).
__label__ct Add Glitch Examples to Documentation
__label__dc - Use a single additional level of indentation for each nested block of code.
__label__cf You can always send pull requests to the GitHub repository.
__label__no - It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.
__label__cf How to Contribute
__label__sc - Tests Add relevant tests and make sure all existing ones still passes. Tests can be run using the command
__label__sc Also, please be patient as not all items will be tested or reviewed immediately by the core team.

__label__no Contributing
__label__no Thank you for your interest in contributing the AWS SDK for Java! We work hardto provide a high quality and useful SDK for our customers, and we appreciateyour interest in helping us and the rest of our community of users. We welcomebug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.
__label__ct - Making your First Code Contribution
__label__no - If you are using WPF/OffScreen runcefclient.exe --multi-threaded-message-loop --off-screen-rendering-enabled --enable-gpu --no-sandbox --disable-site-isolation-trials
__label__no The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.
__label__no Two other committer need to second your nomination. If no one objects in 5 working days (China), you're a committer. If anyone objects or wants more information, the committers discuss and usually come to a consensus (within the 5 working days). If issues cannot be resolved, there's a vote among current committers.
__label__bw If you want to build the project locally

__label__sc - Read the developer documentation.
__label__dc - PowerShell must be CRLF and UTF-8. Git attributes are not used, so Git will not ensure this for you.
__label__sc Dependencies are managed using npm. Only update dependencies when needed for your pull request. Don't rebuild the lockfile.

__label__sc - Make sure yarn.lock is included in your commit.
__label__no Contributing to Colmena
__label__sc If you are only fixing minor things or adding small features, it is Ok to commit to dev. Otherwise, if you are planning something bigger like a refactoring of some files, changing the architecture, adding a component to Clasp, or something like that, then you must create a feature branch. The branch's name should be prefixed with dev- followed by a somewhat descriptive name that tells us what you're doing in that branch.
__label__sc Commit Guidelines
__label__dc Here is the official header for LGPL modules (CCLib, etc.):
__label__no - there are thousands of people willing to help on StackOverflow
__label__dc - Chai Coding Style Guide
__label__sc - a short summary of the changes
__label__sc When creating a pull request, keep the following in mind:
__label__sc - It must follow the Releases rules. See the definition below
__label__no - Plunkr Please: Please create a plunkr
__label__sc Once the feature_x branch has been committed into the upstream/master branch, your local feature_x branch and the origin/feature_x branch are no longer needed.  If you want to make additional changes, restart the process with a new branch.
__label__cf - Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.
__label__no We might ask for further information to locate a bug. A duplicated bug reportwill be closed.
__label__sc - perf: A code change that improves performance
__label__dc This is written in JavaScript, not CoffeeScript;it's only a small amount of JavaScript, so the advantages ofCoffeeScript aren'tobvious, and far more people know basic JavaScript than CoffeeScript.Our JavaScript coding style is based on theNode.js style guide.In particular, we use2-space indents, terminating semicolons, camelCase, required braces,and '===' (never '==') for string comparison,These coding style rules are checked by ESLint(see .eslintrc for the rule list).
__label__cf - If you have not done so yet, you will need to clone your repo onto your local machine for development. git clone https://github.com/your-username/Aurora.git
__label__no Then check if the same problem applies with the same Podfile but in a completely newand empty application Xcode project, thus excluding whether or not there is an issue withconflicting settings.
__label__no To contribute a bug fix to a supported release, please make a pull request offof the supported release branch. For instance, if you find a bug in the 4.3release, then you would make a pull request off of the REL_4_3 branch.
__label__dc - all letters in upper case
__label__sc 2.  Coverage must meet or exceed percentage set in the tox file (usually 98%)
__label__dc Small variations are acceptable, and non-compliance in existing code, byitself, is not something to fix.
__label__no If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us bysubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better you can submit a Pull Requestwith a fix.
__label__sc - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
__label__dc - Document public methods with jsdoc.
__label__cf - Ideally, each theme's folder should contain a README.md file describing the theme and its configuration options.
__label__no - All capital letters
__label__no Contributing to BOINC
__label__no - Suggest things to improve
__label__cf - Data Structure Request
__label__sc Most IDEs can create nice patches now very easily. e.g. in Eclipse just right click on a file/directory and select Team -> Create Patch. Then just save the patch as a file and attach it to the corresponding issue on our https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL[JIRA issue tracker].If you're a command line person try the following to create the patch
__label__sc Now you'll find the built files in c3.js, c3.min.js, c3.css & c3.min.css.

__label__no Branching
__label__sc - Rebasing pull requests is OK and encouraged. After submitting your pull request some changes may be requested. Rather than adding unnecessary extra commits to the pull request, you can squash these changes into the existing commit and then do a force push to your fork. When you do a force push to your fork, the PR will be updated with your new changes, so there is no need to open a new PR to make changes. Leave a comment on the pull request thread to explain that the history has been changed. This will help to keep the commit history of the repository clean.
__label__sc - Pull requests should contain small, incremental change.

__label__no If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Including an issue, reproduction is the absolute best way to help the team quickly diagnose the problem. Screenshots and error stack traces are also helpful.
__label__cf - If you find that the continuous integration tests have failed, look into the logs to find outif your changes caused test failures, the commit message was malformed etc. If you find that thetests failed or times out for unrelated reasons, you can ping a team member so that the build can berestarted.

__label__sc Commit Message Format
__label__sc Must be one of the following:
__label__no - This is not a support forum. If you have a question, please go toThe Cukes Google Group.
__label__sc If you realize you've missed something after submitting a Pull request, just commit to your local branch and push the branch just like you did the first time. This commit will automatically be included in the Pull request.If we ask you to change already published commits using interactive rebase (like squashing or splitting commits or  rewriting commit messages) you need to force push using -f:
__label__dc Do not create methods unless necessary.
__label__sc If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit <hash>., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

__label__dc If you change anything that requires a change to documentation then you will need to add it. New classes, methods, parameters, changing default values, etc are all things that will require a change to documentation. The change-log must also be updated for every change. Also PHPDoc blocks must be maintained.
__label__sc Catch2 has multiple layers of tests that are then run as part of our CI.The most obvious one are the unit tests compiled into the SelfTestbinary. These are then used in "Approval tests", which run (almost) alltests from SelfTest through a specific reporter and then compare thegenerated output with a known good output ("Baseline"). By default, newtests should be placed here.
__label__bw When running yarn start this routes through the CLI and eventually calls yarn dev with the proper arguments. This enables Cypress day-to-day development to match the logic of the built binary + CLI integration.

__label__sc Here's a few general guidelines for proposing changes:
__label__sc Commit Message Format
__label__dc - patch list of keys with its corresponding object (for example dotfile's actions)
__label__dc - Specify imports in the following order: system, blank line, 3rd-party, blank line, own; all sorted alphabetically:
__label__sc We also strive to maintain high test coverage, so most contributions should include additions to the unit tests. These tests are run with pytest, which you can use to locally run any test modules that you've added or changed.
__label__sc At this stage, one should expect comments and review from other contributors. Youcan add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushingto your fork until you have satisfied all feedback.

__label__no - Provide a clear and descriptive title that identifies the problem.
__label__no - Please do not derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic andrespect the opinions of others.
__label__sc Where my-new-branch is the branch that you created for this set of changes(you remember that, right?). If everything goes correctly, then, after a fewseconds, your changes will be right there on the cloud, on github! Yay!
__label__dc - for (..) {
__label__no For bug reports and feature requests submit a github issue
__label__sc - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
__label__sc git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
__label__dc /// This class is only being used as style guide example.class my_class {public:/// Brief description. More description. Note that CAF uses the/// "JavaDoc-style" autobrief option, i.e., everything up until the/// first dot is the brief description.my_class();

__label__sc The ci type cannot have a scope.
__label__sc - If we suggest changes then:
__label__dc - Optimize imports
__label__sc - Ensure that your PR only changes files required for your functionality or bugfix.
__label__no Sometimes we want to introduce new breaking behavior because we believe this isthe correct default behavior for the CDK. The problem of course is that breakingchanges are only allowed in major versions and those are rare.
__label__no Thanks for your interest in contributing to this free open source project! Arduino welcomes help from the community. There are several ways you can get involved:
__label__cf 2.  Please refer to a bug report on the issue list. An example of a good titleis "Fixes problem [x] by doing [y]. Fixes #1555"
__label__sc - Create your patch, including appropriate test cases.
__label__sc Lines should not exceed 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools and produces a nice, neat commit log ie:
__label__sc - If applies, write more descriptive information in the commit body.
__label__no We ask you to do this because StackOverflow does a much better job at keeping popular questions visible. Unfortunately good answers get lost and outdated on GitHub.
__label__no If you're proposing an idea, with the intent to work on it yourself, please openan issue with a title like [RFC] Wouldn't it be swell, if we had [X]?. Thatwill make it obvious that you're open for discussion about the feature, and thatit'll be a good fit for Bolt itself, or that it might be better suited as anextension. If you want to discuss your idea first, before 'officially' postingit, you can always join us on Slack or IRC.
__label__no Issues
__label__no We use GitHub issues to track enhancement requests.  Before you create an enhancement request:

__label__sc - Generate a new project with angular-cli:
__label__tc Community Guidelines
__label__sc The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).
__label__sc - New features that are backwards compatible will be based on the appropriate 'next' branch. For example if you want to contribute to the next 3.x branch, you should base your changes on 3.next.
__label__dc Coding conventions
__label__no - Give your feedback
__label__dc Linting
__label__sc - release: A release commit. Must only include version changes. [2]
__label__dc Azkaban follows the Google code style. The template file,az-intellij-style.xml, can be found in the root directory. It's based on theintellij-java-google-style.xml config file from the google/styleguide project.
__label__dc - Use the param tag to identify all of the parameters.
__label__ct Update Documentation
__label__no - JSDoc
__label__sc - Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
__label__cf Bugfix, fix about current behavior
__label__no - Confirm that performance test is passed and all issues in current Milestone are either closed or can be delayed to later versions.
__label__no - Provide a reduced test case. "Browsersync is not working with my app" is far less helpful than "Here's a example project showing the problem".An example project might contain a single index.html file with some JS/CSS from CDNs & a short description of the issue. If wecan just pull a repo/gist and see the problem for ourselves, your issue will jump straight to the top of the stack.

__label__no Please update the docs accordingly so that there are no discrepancies between the API and the documentation.
__label__tc Please make sure to read and observe our Code of Conduct.
__label__sc - One of the Cake team members, or one of the maintainers, will evaluate it within areasonable time period (which is to say usually within 1-3 weeks).

__label__sc - If the commit is a Breaking Change, please note it clearly in this part.
__label__sc If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
__label__bw The project uses a cake script to specify the build recipe.If you are on Windows, use the build.ps1 script to build the project:
__label__dc npm run watch
__label__dc This project follows the PSR-2 coding style guidelines. There are many ways to check your code for PSR-2. An excellent tool is PHP_CodeSniffer.

__label__cf Contributing to Ansible-NAS is easy! Add your functionality, then raise a pull request on GitHub. A few things to bear in mind:
__label__bw npm run docs:build
__label__bw 1.  Fork the cookiecutter repo on GitHub.
__label__sc <type>(<scope>): <subject><BLANK LINE><body><BLANK LINE><footer>
__label__no - Prefix title of issue with Bug: or Feature:
__label__sc 3.  Once Composer and the WordPress test sutie are installed, you can run phpunit via ./vendor/bin/phpunit in the CMB2 directory.
__label__no Patches
__label__sc - remove abc
__label__sc After your pull request is merged
__label__sc Commit messages
__label__no How to prioritize pull requests, from most to least important:
__label__sc - We rely on your assurances concerning the rights of third parties in relation to your contributions.
__label__sc Test fixtures should go in /tests-for-this-repo/fixtures/lib-name.
__label__no Contributing to Cheerio
__label__no 1.  Open any solution, eg "SDKs\Compute\Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.sln"
__label__cf 6.  PR is merged submitted to merge into develop.
__label__no Short and descriptive example bug report title
__label__sc - docs: Documentation only changes
__label__no What to improve
__label__sc - No Warnings Make sure your code do not produce any build warnings.
__label__sc $ OVERWRITE=true TEST_ONLY=babel-plugin-transform-classes make test-only
__label__no - Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
__label__sc 2.  All pull requests should contain a single commit per issue, or we will ask you to squash it.
__label__no git checkout -b feature-xxx upstream/master
__label__no - packages
__label__no Contributing to iframe-resizer
__label__no - bundle_doctor - sanity check on Ruby gem configuration/installation
__label__tc Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports andfeature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on Slack.
__label__dc 3.  On the Run pane of VSCode, select the run configuration Attach to NodeJS and click the button.
__label__no - Actual response
__label__sc Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easierto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
__label__ct 2.  High level Roadmap
__label__cf Avoid rebasing and force pushes after submitting a pull request, since these make itdifficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. The Druidcommitter that merges your change will rebase and squash it into a single commit beforecommitting it to master.
__label__no TBD: Is this applicable for big features ? What is the best way to merge big features ?

__label__sc - Shorten CI test time for faster releases
__label__dc - Class names and Properties are PascalCase - this is nearly the only time you start with uppercase.
__label__cf Features
__label__no Pull requests
__label__dc Updates sometimes fail.  In particular, sometimes one gem has beenupdate but a related gem is temporarily incompatible.
__label__dc To find all outdated gems, use the 'bundle outdated' command.Many of the gems named "action..." are part of rails, and thus, you shouldupdate rails to update them.
__label__no - It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer whoopened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
__label__tc You can use the Development categoryto ask question about the code, how to compile, etc.If you want to start working in something(issue,bug,or feature),post a comment asking if somebody is already working on that,in that way you can avoid start programming in something that is alreadydone for the next release or which someone else is working on.
__label__dc - Class methods and properties (methods starting with a @)
__label__no All development and pull requests should be made against the current release branch. Master is reserved for the last stable working version of the code. As such, it will often be outdated.
__label__no Contributing to the AWS Cloud Development Kit
__label__bw The vagrant-vbguest plugin will each help with keeping the VirtualBox Guest Additions up-to-date.

__label__no - Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO sign-off.
__label__bw git clone https://github.com/citusdata/citus.git
__label__no - Provide a clear and descriptive title
__label__no # Or to link all core superset-ui and plugin packages:# npm link ../../superset-ui/{packages,plugins}/*
__label__bw On ubuntu 16, it's as simple of editing this file:/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq-localhost.conf (create if does not exist)And add this line to it: address=/captain.localhost/192.168.1.2 where 192.168.1.2 is your local IP address.To make sure you have dnsmasq, you can run which dnsmasq on your terminal, if it's available,path of it will be printed on the terminal, otherwise, there won't be anything printed on your terminal.

__label__sc Step 7: Send the pull request
__label__sc - One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
__label__no - This helps prevent mistakes such as if (a & 1 == 0)
__label__sc - or to execute a single test npm test -- -g 'some regexp that matches the test description'
__label__sc We also have support for running the Mocha tests in IE9+ and other old browsers.  You can run the tests in a Windows IE VM while running npm run watch:umd.  Go to http://youripaddress:8081/test/ie.html in IE to open the Mocha test page.

__label__no Guidelines for Contributing Code, Examples, Documentation
__label__cf The contributing workflow relies on Github Pull Requests.
__label__dc Avoid silent failures. In general, we use exceptions for cases that an application can recover from, such as when image decoding or glsl compilation fails. For situations that a user cannot possibly recover from, it is better to use assertions and the handy CI_ASSERT macro. However, as is the case many times, there are no rules set in stone for choosing one technique over the other, or choosing a different way to handle an error altogether (such as logging). When in doubt, post your code for peer review.

__label__no 2.  Specifics:
__label__no - Specify the Android version and the ROM you're using.You can also include any root or customization related information like Magisk or SuperSU version and Xposed modules is installed.
__label__dc 6.  If you must cast a variable to any - try to type it back as fast as possible. (e.g., const cw = ((zeroEx as any)._contractWrappers as ContractWrappers);). This ensures subsequent code is type-safe.

__label__bw # Start a watcher that recompiles your assets as you modify them (but have to manually reload your browser to see changes.)npm run dev
__label__cf - Create a new pull request on the main Aurora repo.
__label__no This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source codeheld within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would beextremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.
__label__dc When there is a single implementation, don't introduce an interface. When there is a need for asecond implementation, refactor the code to introduce an interface as needed.The person making that change in the future will know more (two implementations) than you do now (one implementation)and they will use that knowledge to make better API choices. Modern IDEs have good support forsuch refactoring. There is less IDE support for removing an interface.

__label__dc - All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
__label__sc You can combine TEST_DEBUG with TEST_GREP or TEST_ONLY to debug a subset of tests. If you plan to stay long in the debugger (which you'll likely do!), you may increase the test timeout by editing test/testSetupFile.js.

__label__cf 3.  If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign aContributor License Agreement (see details above).
__label__cf - Feature Request
__label__cf - Re-order the lines to change commit order (to the extent possible without creating conflicts)
__label__sc - Push your changes to the branch in your fork of the repository.
__label__sc Use GraphViz with template-deps-to-dot:
__label__bw You should have JDK 1.8 or later installed in your system.
__label__dc For infinite loops, while loops, and do-while loops, we need these to be exceptionally clear. So in the case of any of these we will use hanging brackets.
__label__no Opening issues without providing us with the information necessary to debug and fix it is useless; so we will close such issues within 7 days period
__label__sc BREAKING CHANGE:
__label__dc - Command substitution
__label__sc The commit message should specify which package is affected by the change. For example:material, cdk-experimental, etc.
__label__dc - f for Force
__label__no - A short, descriptive title. Ideally, other community members should be ableto get a good idea of the issue just from reading the title.
__label__no alt text
__label__no Also: no typo is too small to fix! Really. Of course, batches of fixes arepreferred, but even one nit is one nit too many.

__label__cf See the contributing guide for details.
__label__sc 4.  Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
__label__cf How to contribute
__label__no Add contributing guide
__label__no 1.  This is the first step
__label__no - fasterer - report on Ruby constructs with poor performance(temporarily disabled until it supports Ruby 2.4)
__label__cf - Compiler assumptions (doc/design/compiler-assumptions.md)
__label__dc Instead, cast the result of objectAtIndex: to the appropriate type, and then call the method. (TODO learn about, then decide a policy on, soft-generics on things other than id)
__label__bw 4)  Launch SampleClient.exe to begin downloading. All files will be downloaded to a directory called "Downloads".Note: Only statistics will only be shown for the first .torrent loaded into the engine. So there is no real pointin loading more than one .torrent into the engine.
__label__dc Coding Style
__label__no If you would like to write tutorials or blog posts for ASP.NET Boilerplate, please let us know (by creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate/issues), so we may add a link to your tutorial/post in the official documentation and we announce it on the official Twitter account.
__label__no The specific list of tools run by default using 'rake' is listed indefault.rake.Currently these include at least the following rake tasks thatcheck the software:
__label__ct When should I create an issue?
__label__sc - Old patch submission guideline
__label__no - Documentation
__label__dc - Place requires in the following order:
__label__dc - The automated testing framework that Chocolatey uses is NUnit, TinySpec, Moq, and Should. Do not be thrown off thinking it using something else based on seeing Fact attributes for specs/tests. That is TinySpec.
__label__sc - A PR should do one clear thing that obviously improves Caffe, and nothing more. Making many smaller PRs is better than making one large PR; review effort is superlinear in the amount of code involved.
__label__sc - Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.
__label__no Do your homework before asking a question
__label__no How to become a contributor and submit your own code
__label__no NOT GROUPED BY
__label__dc - We use eslint to check coding guidelines and conventions.Run grunt lint to confirm that your code meets the dc.js style guidelines.See .eslintrc for current rules.
__label__no - Submit your contribution
__label__sc This procedure will apply only your commits in order to the current master, then you will squash them to a single commit, and then you force push your local THRIFT-9999-take-2 into remote THRIFT-9999 which represents your pull request, replacing all the commits with the new one.
__label__no In this example, luminous,centos,7, $CEPH_VERSION will be set to luminous.
__label__no About to create a new Github Issue?
__label__dc - Is the package importable even if the C-extensions are not built?
__label__no - The commands you ran.
__label__no - help wanted
__label__no When requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Opensource projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think aboutwhether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.
__label__sc git checkout master -f
__label__no - explain what outcome you expected
__label__no When a build is made with the deprecation preprocessor symbols defined, a compiler warning will be generated to warn a user that the function will be removed at some point in the future, notifying users that they should change from the older deprecated function to the newer function at their own convenience.
__label__ct - All issues labeled with the "Good For Community" label are fair game. That's a great way to contribute new features and fix small issues within Jetpack.
__label__sc When adding links to outside resources within the Cypress Test Runner (including links to Cypress's own documentation), we utilize our cypress-on service for all links.
__label__sc Here is a check list for the review:
__label__no Contributing
__label__dc - Prefer simplicity, readability, and maintainability over terseness.
__label__ct - Maintainer for brew packages wanted
__label__sc - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
__label__dc libui uses K&R C formatting rules for overall code structure: spaces after keywords like if, { on the same line as a statement with a space, { on its own line after a function or method signature (even those inside the class body), no space after the name of a function, etc.
__label__dc - Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.
__label__no - Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
__label__dc const selectedNote: A.Reducer<T.NoteEntity[] | null> = (state = null, action) => {switch (action.type) {case 'CREATE_NOTE':return makeNote();
__label__no Revert Guidelines
__label__no - Issues should be limited to one conversation error and describe it in detail
__label__no - Parameters validators are defined in /server/middlewares/validators directory
__label__no - Use .\choco.exe to point to the local file. By default in PowerShell.exe, if you have Chocolatey installed, when you call choco, that is using the installed choco and not the one in the folder you are currently in. You must be explicit. This catches nearly everyone.
__label__no - No need to add a new version header at this point - this should be done when a new release is made, later.
__label__sc Every commit that goes into the master branch is audited and reviewed by somebody from Cossack Labs, so don't be surprised if it takes longer than you expect.
__label__no How Can I Contribute?
__label__cf - Leave a comment on the issue to let us know you are working on it and add yourself as a watcher to get informed about all modifications.
__label__no Support Requests
__label__no Dependency Updates Checklist
__label__sc - Commit the built files to the release branch
__label__dc # frozen_string_literal: true
__label__bw - Download Ballerina and go through the learning resources.
__label__sc Don't be discouraged if your pull request is rejected. This is not a deadline and sometimes with a proper explanation on your side, we are persuaded to merge in the request. Just remember that this is a library for everyone and as such must meet certain, generic rules that we would like to believe are following.
__label__bw You can either install and run the application using npm or use docker.
__label__cf 1.  Fork the project on Github (top right on the project page)
__label__bw Or https:
__label__sc Footer
__label__cf 3.  To implement a feature or bug-fix for an existing outstanding issue, pleaseFollow the code contributions guide below. If youneed more context on a particular issue, please ask in a comment.
__label__tc - Sign-in to Apache JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/
__label__no Tips about Feature Request
__label__dc - Wrap code at 80 chars.
__label__no Linking Server Core for Development
__label__no See the LICENSE file for our project's licensing. We will ask you to confirm the licensing of your contribution.
__label__dc The project also uses immutable types where ever possible. If adding new type(s), ideally make them immutable.
__label__dc - Please do not run build/dist script and do not bump version number for the script. These things will be handled by the maintainers when necessary.
__label__dc Instead of using java.util.List, java.util.HashMap, and other standard Java collections, use Array, ObjectMap and other equivalents from arc.struct.Why? Because that's what the rest of the codebase uses, and the standard collections have a lot of cruft and usability issues associated with them.In the rare case that concurrency is required, you may use the standard Java classes for that purpose (e.g. CopyOnWriteArrayList).
__label__no Required knowledge: Sphinx
__label__no 2.  Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using thelatest master or development branch in the repository.
__label__sc Creating a Pull Request
__label__dc - Member variables and member function names should be in lower camel case. Examples: getUnitsInRectangle, wasSeenByBWAPIPlayer.

__label__no This document describes how to set up a development environment and submit your contributions. Please read it carefullyand let us know if it's not up-to-date (even better, submit a PR with your  corrections ;-)).
__label__dc When committing files, we run a Git pre-commit hook to lint the staged JS files. See the lint-staged project.If this command fails, you may need to run yarn lint-changed --fix and commit those changes.
__label__no - Report any bugs and request features via GitHub Issues.
__label__no Please see the Submission Guidelines below.
__label__sc - Summary should be a brief description of your change within one sentence.
__label__no - The issue list of this repository is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.
__label__sc You will need an install of Composer before continuing.
__label__bw git clone git@github.com:your-username/react-spinners.git
__label__no Special Note for Localization Issues: AngularJS uses the Google Closure I18N library togenerate its own I18N files (the ngLocale module). This means that any changes to these fileswould be lost the next time that we import the library.Since the Closure library i18n data is itself auto-generated from the data of theCommon Locale Data Repository (CLDR) project, errors in the data shouldbe reported there. See also the Closure guide to i18n changes.
__label__no Filing an issue
__label__sc 1.  All significant changes require an Apache Jira THRIFT Issue ticket.  Trivial changes such as fixing a typo or a compiler warning do not.

__label__dc Please keep in mind that people spend their free time trying to help you. You can make it easier for them if you provide versions of the relevant libraries and a runnable small project reproducing your issue. You can put your code on JSBin or, for bigger projects, on GitHub. Make sure all the necessary dependencies are declared in package.json so anyone can run npm install && npm start and reproduce your issue.
__label__no - Respond promptly to any questions made by the maintainers about your issue. Staleissues will be closed (eventually).
__label__ct - Reviewing pull requests
__label__sc This configuration file setup the pytest-cov plugin and it is an additional dependency. It generate a coverage report after the tests.

__label__sc We recommend you create patches as github PRs which is much easier for us to accept and work with. You do this as any other github project, where you can fork the project, and create a branch where you work on the code, and then commit and push that code to your fork. Then navigate to the Apache Camel github webpage, and you will see that github in the top of the page has a wizard to send your recent work as a PR (pull request).

__label__tc Please be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show theworld that developers are civilized and selfless people.
__label__no Example:
__label__cf Pull requests that refactor the code should not be made by new contributors. Itrequires a certain level of experience to know where the code belongs to and tounderstand the full ramification (including rebase effort of open pull requests).
__label__no - Browsers and Operating System - is this a problem with all browsers?

__label__sc How to submit a feature request
__label__ct - The "Easy Fix" List
__label__no It's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions to the project are of sufficientquality to benefit the project. Many developers have different skillsets, strengths, and weaknesses. Respect the maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.
__label__sc git checkout master -f
__label__sc - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
__label__sc - Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.
__label__no - The use cases you see for this feature.
__label__no - [ ] The feature/bugfix is self-documenting from within the product.
__label__bw In the run() method of the DatabaseSeeder:
__label__no Useful Commands:
__label__sc git submodule initgit submodule update
__label__no - Do you have an idea for a new feature? Then don't expect it to be implemented unless you or someone else sends a pull request. You might be better to start a discussion on the google group.
__label__no - Merge the template in.
__label__no If you're reading this, you're probably looking to contributing to Camelot. Time is the only real currency, and the fact that you're considering spending some here is very generous of you. Thank you very much!

__label__cf - To help increase the projects functionality
__label__sc When contributing a pull request, be sure to submit your pull request againstthe master branch. SeePull Request Workflow for further details.
__label__sc - Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
__label__cf 4.  When working on the code, you can use the watch mode to watch and compiles changed files:
__label__no Adding features to AWS SAM
__label__no You can file new issues by selecting from our new issue templates and filling out the issue template.
__label__sc The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.
__label__bw You can open src\MonoTorrent.sln in any IDE.
__label__bw Set up the ANTLR4 plugin
__label__no - Mock / Fake / Stub / Double - an object that provides a known state back to the system under test when the system under test interacts with other objects. This can be done with unit and whitebox integration testing. This allows for actual unit testing as most units (classes/functions) depend on working with other units (classes/functions) to get or set information and state. While each of these are slightly different, the basic functionality is that they are standing in for other production code.
__label__dc - yarn pack: packages all modules to all supported languages and produces a dist/ directory with all the outputs(running this script requires that you installed the toolchains for all target languages on yoursystem).

__label__no In general, we prefer that technical issues and committer status/TSC membership are amicably worked outbetween the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the TSC can becalled in to decide an issue. If the TSC themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue willbe resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each TSC receives one vote.
__label__no Submitting bug reports
__label__cf - Make changes. See below.

__label__dc To practically aid developers, helpful tools have been built for staging:
__label__no TC Process
__label__cf If you reformat code or hit core functionality without an approval from a person on the Cake Team,it's likely that no matter how awesome it looks afterwards, it will probably not get accepted.Reformatting code makes it harder for us to evaluate exactly what was changed.
__label__cf - If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
__label__no - Comment the code
__label__sc You can submit a bugfix without a test, although those take MUCH longer toreview because it's often hard to work out what problem you're solving.
__label__no - Samples: includes sample code in multiple languages
__label__no Contributing
__label__cf - Small Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.
__label__cf Development Workflow
__label__cf Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

__label__cf Finally send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
__label__cf Contribute Code
__label__dc Android and RoboVM (iOS) do not support many of Java 8's features, such as the packages java.util.function, java.util.stream or forEach in collections. Do not use these in your code.If you need to use functional interfaces, use the ones in arc.func, which are more or less the same with different naming schemes.
__label__cf 3.  Commit changes to your own branch

__label__sc - git rebase upstream/master
__label__sc The method of testing as you will see is a file that contains many test classes (scenarios) that set up and perform a behavior, then perform one or more validations (tests/facts) on that scenario. Typically when in a unit test suite, there would be a file for every representative class in the production code. You may not see this as much in this codebase as there are areas that could use more coverage.

__label__no The Hue project gladly welcomes pull requests!
__label__no If you are familiar with Ruby, making a pull request with a failing test casecan speed up the resolution of the bug. If the issue is more complex you canadd an integration testwhich doesn't require any ruby knowledge.
__label__cf Development Life Cycle
__label__no - What should I Contribute?
__label__sc - CocoaPods uses bacon as a test runner.To run all tests, use bundle exec rake spec in the root of theRainforest repo. If you want to runa specific test instead, use bundle exec bacon spec/[folder]/[name]_spec.rb
__label__cf Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how CefSharp works. If you have an idea for a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc - please be sure to:
__label__no Release
__label__sc All tests should run locally by default.
__label__no We use Vagrant to isolate all of our dependencies without polluting your normal working environment.
__label__sc - Should still submit a PR for changes (i.e. no work should be done on a branch directly; all work should be done in it's own separate feature branch), which should be okayed by one other team member before merging.
__label__sc Run yarn test to run Jest. Supports all the Jest options.
__label__sc - Ensure all status checks pass. PR's with test failures will not be merged. PR's with insufficient coverage may be merged depending on the situation.
__label__cf 1.  Fork the repository on GitHub.
__label__cf Task management. Once the feature idea is agreed upon and translated into concrete actions and tasks, please use the issue tracker to create an issue for each individual task. Further technical discussion about the task and the implementation details should be carried out in the issue tracker.
__label__no If the __DO_STUFF__ file is supposed to contain actions that need done it generally needs toreturn true. As an example, echo 'first' && __DO_STUFF__ && echo 'last' will print 'first' and'last' correctly only if __DO_STUFF__ returns true. A take-no-action override needs to have thecontent /bin/true, as an empty file will cause an error.

__label__no - GitHub issues tracker (some problems have been answered there),
__label__cf - If the issue has not been reported, please add a detailed description of the bug in the PR.
__label__sc This command will automatically run the specification suite and report its results.
__label__no I hope you enjoy working with Vagrant as much as we do and feel free to ask questions if you get stuck or have a problem. You're probably not alone and even if you're the first to encounter a rough patch you won't be the last.
__label__dc - jhelpers.py: list of methods available in templates with jinja2
__label__sc You can also serve and view the docs locally with
__label__no Intranet
__label__no Ideally, adding a new Ceph release is fairly easy. In the best case, all that needs done is addingflavors for the new Ceph version to the Makefile. At minimum, ALL_BUILDABLE_FLAVORS must beupdated in the Makefile. If distro source is properly configured to support multiple Ceph releasesand there are no special updates required, they are likely to work with just this minimal change.
__label__no - Develop
__label__no - Enhancement Requests
__label__no - vulnerability reporting,
__label__no If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding newfeatures by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase thechances of your issue being dealt with quickly:
__label__sc Then, you can start over and include only what you meant to put in a singlecommit.
__label__no Releasing a new version of a GA'ed libary
__label__sc Additional Pull Request Requirements
__label__sc - Sometimes you will find that even a tiny code change has a commit body that needs to be very detailed and make take more time to do than the actual change itself!
__label__no 1.  Check that the code has a license. If you can't find one, you can try to contact the original author and get permission to use, or ask them to release under a compatible Open Source license.
__label__ct - Help wanted issues - issues which may be a bit more involved, but are specifically seeking community contributions
__label__cf - Share an RFC for new features or big changes
__label__no First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It's peoplelike you that make Active Admin such a great tool.
__label__no A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository.Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!
__label__sc Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.
__label__cf Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
__label__no - please ensure you are requiring and starting SimpleCov before requiring any application code.
__label__cf bundle exec rake
__label__cf - Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.
__label__cf - Report security issues

__label__sc Once you've made your great commits:
__label__no - Set up the development environment
__label__sc It is the job of CI linting and tests to notify of style issues within thecodebase. If it is not possible for style issues to be encapsulated as alinting rule, it shouldn't be concretely enforced during the review process.This can ensure that code reviews contain more meaningful feedback tied to thecontribution rather than nit-picking on stylistic choices.
__label__no Starting from v3.0.0, Behat is following Semantic Versioning v2.0.0.This means that we take backwards compatibility of public API very seriously. So unless you want your PR to start anew major version of Behat (v4.0.0 for example), you need to make sure that either you do not change existinginterfaces and their usage across the system or that you at least introduce backwards compatibility layer together withyour change. Not following these rules will cause a rejection of your PR. Exception could be an extremely rare casewhere BC break is introduced as a measure to fix a serious issue.
__label__sc - Delete the local branch:
__label__no - General how to's and blog posts
__label__sc 2.  Branch your fork. This is your active development branch

__label__sc PRs must include testing information to ensure the changes are functional and do not adversely affect other library functionsTesting information must include one or more of the following:
__label__sc - don't capitalize first letter
__label__no Feature Requests
__label__no TO TEST:
__label__no Here are some tips.
__label__sc - If it is a trivial commit or one of formatting/spaces fixes, it should be prefixed with (maint).
__label__sc Fork, then clone the repo:
__label__no For the technical details on how to implement new criteria,or modify existing criteria (including their text, details, rationale,and scoring criteria), seeimplementation.md.
__label__dc - PSR-1 & PSR-2 compliance for all code
__label__cf While developing, you can run the example app to test your changes.

__label__sc 3.  In CircleCI, configure your project to add an environment variable, with name COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN, and for the value paste in the Repo Token you copied in step 1.
__label__sc - When the pull request is targeting the wrong branch (this doesn't happen as often).
__label__sc - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
__label__cf - Commits should represent one logical change each; if a feature goes through multiple iterations, squash your commits down to one
__label__bw Building
__label__no Try running with troubleshooting messages (protractor --troubleshoot) against your configuration to make sure that there is not an error with your setup.

__label__sc The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you?
__label__sc make typecheck
__label__bw Full clean build
__label__no - Using welcoming and inclusive language
__label__sc Writing tests for the babel parser is verysimilar to the other packages.Inside the packages/babel-parser/test/fixtures folder are categories/groupings of test fixtures (es2015, flow,etc.). To add a test, create a folder under one of these groupings (or create a new one) with adescriptive name, and add the following:
__label__sc The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.
__label__sc New features should also be accompanied with:
__label__sc Describe your changes
__label__no Reporting security issues
__label__sc There are also two more kinds of tests, examples and "ExtraTests".Examples serve as a compilation test on the single-header distribution,and present a small and self-contained snippets of using Catch2 forwriting tests. ExtraTests then are tests that either take a long timeto run, or require separate compilation, e.g. because of testing compiletime configuration options, and take a long time because of that.
__label__no Write documentation
__label__dc - No spaces around parentheses: if(condition){, SomeType s = (SomeType)object
__label__dc To clarify, a module should have as small a responsibility as possible without requiring non-core modules. This makes the module easier to maintain and minimizes code fragility and code entanglement.

__label__tc - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or emailaddress, without their explicit permission
__label__bw You can now run php artisan db:seed and you will have a substantial amount of views for each post.
__label__no - Confirm that performance test is passed and all issues in current Milestone are either closed or can be delayed to later versions.
__label__dc - If there is something you think is not obvious in an implementation, then comments can help clarify, but in general it is nice to let the code do the explaining.
__label__bw One can use the postinstall script to symlink this repo:
__label__bw $ cd <path_to_awscli>$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt$ python -m pip install -e .
__label__sc The CLI package (packages/aws-cdk) has some integration tests that aren'trun as part of the regular build, since they have some particular requirements.See the CLI CONTRIBUTING.md file formore information on running those tests.

__label__no Reporting an issue
__label__cf Development Process
__label__sc - Documented by /// documentation for Doxygen
__label__no - Unit Testing - We define a unit as a class and a method in C#. In PowerShell this is per function. If it involves another class or function, you have graduated to an integration. This is where Mocks come in to ensure no outside state is introduced.
__label__sc We use GitHub to track proposed changes via itsissue tracker andpull requests.Specific changes are proposed using those mechanisms.Issues are assigned to an individual, who works it and then marks it complete.If there are questions or objections, the conversation area of thatissue or pull request is used to resolve it.
__label__sc 3.  Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) tocontain your feature, change, or fix:

__label__no Financial contributions
__label__sc The license tells you what rights you have that are provided by the copyright holder. It is important that the contributor fully understands what rights they are licensing and agrees to them. Sometimes the copyright holder isn't the contributor, such as when the contributor is doing work on behalf of a company.
__label__no Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.
__label__sc It is important that you maintain an up-to-date master branch in your local repository.  This is done by rebasing in the code changes from upstream/master (the official Apache Shiro project repository) into your local repository.  You will want to do this before you start working on a feature as well as right before you submit your changes as a pull request.  I recommend you do this process periodically while you work to make sure you are working off the most recent project code.
__label__no Contributing to Citus
__label__no - Full steps to reproduce the issue, including minimal reproduction code. A minimal reproduction means only what is necessary to display the problem and nothing more. This is perhaps the most important thing, don't skip it!

__label__no Hi, folks, thanks for pay attention to GCanvas. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines.
__label__no Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the template.
__label__no If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it. However, before submitting it, please:
__label__sc - The changes cannot break any existing functional/unit tests that are part of the central repository.
__label__no - Compiler, runtime, standard library, or tooling: ballerina-lang repo
__label__no - The behavior you're seeing. If at all possible, please submit a reduced repro or test that demonstrates the issue.
__label__sc - Please create the branch in the format feature/<issue-id>-<issue-name> (eg: feature/235-contact-panel)
__label__sc - Create a new topic branch for every separate change you make.
__label__sc - You make the PR on the same branch you based your changes on. If you see commitsthat you did not make in your PR, you're doing it wrong.
__label__no Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.
__label__tc Please remember the issue tracker on github is not for user support.  Please also do not email developers directly for support.  Instead please use IRC or the forums first, then if the problem is confirmed create an issue that details how to repeat the problem so it can be investigated.
__label__cf - How to Contribute to Open Source
__label__dc - Make sure you follow the coding-style guidance for Peloton.
__label__no You may think this template does not apply to your case but please think again. A long description will never be asclear as a code chunk with the output you expect from it (for either bug report or new features).
__label__no - Google Chrome auditor.  View a web page, then select menu / more tools /developer tools / audits.  This runs a variety of tests and checks,including some security checks of the code delivered to the browser.Note that not all reports are relevant.
__label__no Filing a bug report
__label__sc - Copy demo application into docs directory.
__label__no Code Studio Contribution Guide
__label__no Congratulations! You are done. Just wait for us to review your code.
__label__bw Make sure you have bundler, then install the dependencies:
__label__no - rel/version: Release tracking branch for each new release
__label__bw npm install --global webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
__label__dc Please do not use or include trailing whitespace(spaces or tabs at the end of a line).Since they are often not visible, they can cause silent problemsand misleading unexpected changes.For example, some editors (e.g., Atom) quietly delete them by default.
__label__sc - Submit a pull request(how to create a pull request).Don't put more than one feature/fix in a single pull request.
__label__dc - Use two spaces and no tabs.
__label__no A summary of the issue and the Visual Studio, browser, OS environmentsin which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
__label__tc - Even though Slack is a chat service, sometimes it takes several hours for community members to respond — please be patient!
__label__dc - Use Debug configuration - debug configuration keeps your local changes separate from the machine installed Chocolatey.
__label__cf Code Contributions
__label__cf - Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows ourcommit message conventions. Adherence to the commit message conventions is required,because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
__label__sc 5.  Modify or write a test case/s in Rspec for your changes
__label__sc - The preview branch is a snapshot of the last AzureRM release and should not be used for active development
__label__sc - Re-run the Colmena test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
__label__cf - Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).
__label__no Documentation, READMEs, examples, and FAQs are important. Please help improve and add to them.
__label__no 5.  Expected result
__label__sc Type
__label__sc Legal
__label__sc Make sure your code change follows the style guide. To format your code, run ./tools/format-code.sh.

__label__sc [Skip step 1 to 3 if you have already done this]
__label__tc If you have any questions, create an issue (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).You can also reach us at hello@react-slick.opencollective.com.
__label__no - Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
__label__sc - Your code should work on other platforms running the bourne shell (/bin/sh), not just BASH.
__label__tc There are no hard and fast rules for what I will and will not accept - please just ask via an issue before implementing. Generally, things I have rejected in the past:
__label__tc Code Conduct
__label__sc fix($compile): [BREAKING_CHANGE] couple of unit tests for IE9
__label__no - Review the code
__label__no If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@beefproject.com instead.
__label__no Which Branch?
__label__sc - docs: Documentation-only changes
__label__no - Issues with no clear steps to reproduce will not be triaged. If an issue is labeled with "needs info" and receives no further replies from the author of the issue for more than 5 days, it will be closed.
__label__dc - Name new variables and functions in lower-case and after what purpose they serve.

__label__sc - You are developing a feature for the CLI and plan on submitting a Pull Request.
__label__sc - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
__label__sc - Remove [WIP] when ready for review. Please note that it may be merged soon after approved so please make sure the PR is ready to merge and do not expect more time for post-approval edits.
__label__dc > This will be the intro. The detail descriptions...
__label__ct 3.  Check Github issues or the bug tracking system
__label__sc - In GitHub, send a pull request to ngx-admin:master.

__label__no - Pull Request Checklist
__label__sc 3.  Rebase the latest project code into your feature_x branch so it is up-to-date with the upstream code
__label__cf git push origin my-fix-branch
__label__sc - Be prepared for detailed feedback on your patch and to make several revisions.
__label__no --- a/spec/spec_helper.rb
__label__no - If the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in theCodeMirror distribution, please provide an HTML document that demonstratesthe problem. The best way to do this is to go tojsbin.com, enter it there, press save, andinclude the resulting link in your bug report.
__label__dc DO NOT USE #REGIONS full stop.
__label__cf Work on a feature branch.If your changes need to be modified due to some reviews, it is less clutter to tweak an isolated feature branch and push it again.
__label__no 1.  Open VS 2019 Command Propmpt
__label__no We are open to adding features but ultimately control the scope and aims of theproject. If a proposed feature is likely to incur high testing, maintenance, orperformance costs it is also unlikely to be accepted. If a strong case existsfor a given feature, we may be persuaded on merit. Be specific.
__label__bw Importing checkstyle project to IntelliJ

__label__dc Coding style
__label__cf Want to hack on git-remote-dropbox? Awesome!
__label__no - CSharp
__label__cf Finally, be aware that since git-crypt is security-sensitive software,the bar for contributions is higher than average.  Please don't bediscouraged by this, but be prepared for patches to possibly go throughseveral rounds of feedback and improvement before being accepted.Your patience and understanding is appreciated.
__label__ct - Pick an issue. If no issue exists (search first) create one.
__label__dc - If you add a new file, also ensure you add it to the Visual Studio project and ensure it becomes an embedded resource.
__label__no Steps to report a bug:
__label__no All contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in atimely manner, and added as a committer, and be given write access to therepository.
__label__cf 2. Environment Setup
__label__dc - Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project:
__label__tc Got a Question or Problem?
__label__bw Replace <my-snippet-name> with the name of the snippet you are adding.
__label__cf 5.  If fixing a bug or adding new functionality, add or update any tests you deem appropriate.
__label__no - What do you expect from Conan.
__label__no - dotnet msbuild eng\mgmt.proj /t:CreateNugetPackage /p:scope=Compute
__label__dc Code Style Guidelines
__label__sc - Try to add test cases that trigger exceptions. If an exception cannot be easily triggered using a test case then it should probably be an assertion. This is not always true (e.g. out of memory errors are exceptions).
__label__sc - Make the required updates.
__label__tc - Additional support is available via the Google Group or on irc.freenode.net#chaijs.

__label__cf 4.  Create a pull request containing just the one change you want to contribute back to PHPCI. If you have more than one feature or bug fix, please create separate branches within your repository, and then submit a separate pull request for each one. Your pull request should use the template detailed below.

__label__sc - Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows ourcommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventionsis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
__label__sc Commit Message Guidelines
__label__sc Pull requests (PRs) are reviewed by the merge team.Generally, PRs require two "+1" before they can be merged by someone on the merge team.The since Contiki 3.0, the merging policy is the following:
__label__dc When contributing, the code conventions above must be followed. Otherwise, the CI builds will automatically fail and your PR will not be merged until the non-conforming code is fixed. It is highly recommended to set up a pre-commit hook which will check your code style before every commit. Here is how to do that:
__label__cf 2.  Clone fork to local repository
__label__dc - prettier is king
__label__no - Star this project to keep me going
__label__dc - Use the keywords default, delete, override, final, etc.

__label__no It can be overwhelming to be offered the chance to wipe the source code for a project. Do not worry, we do not let you push to master. All code is peer-reviewed, and we have the convention that someone other than the submitter should merge non-trivial pull requests.
__label__sc The tests require a database connection to work. You can tell the tests whichcredentials to use by setting the applicable environment variables:
__label__sc We don't use the git-flow tools, but this is useful anyway.
__label__sc 4.  Push your changes to your fork (git push origin my_awesome_feature)
__label__cf As you can see from [GitHub] (https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris), Apache Doris (incubating) code base mainly consists of three parts: Frontend (FE), Backend (BE) and Broker (to support file reading on external storage systems such as HDFS). Documents are mainly the wiki on Doris website and GitHub, as well as the online help manual when running Doris. Details of these components can be found in the following table:

__label__no Path Length : To account for the 260 characters Path Length Limit encountered on windows OS, file paths within the repo is keep below 210 characters. This gives you a runway of 49 characters as clone path for your repo. Paths longer that 260 characters will cause the build to break on windows OS and on CI. Assuming you clone to the default VisualStudio location such that the root of your clone is C:\Users\\**USERNAME**\Source\Repos\azure-sdk-for-net your username will have to be 9 characters long to avoid build errors caused by long paths. Consider using C:\git as you clone path.

__label__no Unless you ran in to a heisenbug,it should be possible to reproduce thebug in a testing environment. To that end run$HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick/test/interactive and reproduce the bug.  Thisscript drops you into a new shell where $HOME is set to an (almost) emptytemporary folder. If you cannot reproduce the bug there, the error is likelywith your setup and not homeshick. Otherwise attach the commands you executedin that environment to the issue.

__label__tc Code of Conduct
__label__no The preferred way to report bugs is to use theGitHub issue tracker. Beforereporting a bug, read these pointers.
__label__no Build without any scope will build all management SDK's.
__label__sc - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
__label__no The most useful feedback is based on the latest development code, and in the case of crashes should include a stack backtrace made using a debug build.
__label__bw - npm run build will build the component for publishing to npm and also bundle the demo app.
__label__sc You are encouraged to use angular commit-message-format to write commit message. In this way, we could have a more trackable history and an automatically generated changelog.
__label__no The library comes with a standalone application.
__label__sc jspm install
__label__no - Client side
__label__sc Replaced algorithm A with algorithm B in apollo/modules/control.

__label__cf 1.  Fork our repository and optionally give it a star when you like it.
__label__dc Importing Types
__label__no First of all, thank you for contributing, you're awesome!
__label__no Release candidates (RCs) occur just before a release. A release candidate shouldbe considered stable, and is typically used for a final round of bug checkingand testing. Multiple release candidates can occur in the event of serious bugs.The format for a release candidate tag is v4.3.0-rc.1, which in thiscase indicates it is the first release candidate for 4.2.
__label__bw Next Steps
__label__dc There is an established format for components which utilizes one JS (init.js) and one CSS (screen.css) which is handled by the loader file. Any other resources used should be loaded or accessed from one of these.
__label__bw Automated Setup

__label__no Issues can span a variety of topics including:
__label__dc Code conventions
__label__no Ground Rules
__label__sc $ git commit --amend
__label__sc - If the PR only edits a single package, add it's name too
__label__no - at least 8 PR and the associated issues to the project,
__label__sc - Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
__label__cf - Code: the code you are adding, which should followour coding guidelines as much as possible.
__label__dc - redux: the library itself has really great docs
__label__ct - It shouldn't fundamentally change the way the installer works. At least not during the v1.x series. We don't know in what ways the installer is used currently, but we don't want to break those uses.Such changes could be considered for a v2.x series, but there are no plans for that right now.
__label__sc - It's RECOMMENDED to commit bugfix or feature PR to develop.
__label__cf - Try surf the documentation - if somethings confusing or not clear, let us know.
__label__dc Any changes made to one implementation must be also made to the other implementation.  This is required.  Every time we make an exception to this requirement the project becomes harder to maintain.  This will become painfully clear, should you find yourself unable to port changes from one implementation to the other due to implementations being out of sync. We made this a requirement several years ago and there are still open issues for changes that people promised to port "in the next week or two".  The entire HTML beautifier is an example of this. :(
__label__no If the problem is resolved, feel free to voice your desire for a new release of Celluloid on IRC (irc.freenode.net/#celluloid).
__label__dc You can also add a few useful aliases to your shell profile:
__label__sc 2.  specific version branchs.
__label__sc - Copy over the Bash-Snippets tool skeleton to the newly created folder
__label__cf pg_shard's maintainers prefer that bug reports, feature requests, and pullrequests are submitted as GitHub Issues. If you think you require personalassistance, please do not open an issue: email the pg_shard Google Groupinstead.
__label__no - fix(b-modal): fixes some broken modal stuff
__label__bw # macOSdocker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=$USER postgres# Windows PowerShelldocker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=$env:UserName postgres
__label__bw - Environment Setup
__label__no The retry messages, when they happen, come fromthe few tests we use that use a full simulated web browser (via Capybara).Sometimes these full tests cause spurious failures, so we intentionallyretry failing tests to eliminate false failure reports (to make sure theproblem is in the software under test, and not in our test framework).
__label__sc GitHub provides additional document on forking a repository andcreating a pull request.
__label__cf Contributing A Patch
__label__dc Formatting
__label__sc $ composer install
__label__ct - Fixes to non-production code - like fixing something small in the build code.

__label__cf If you would like to start the Tracker the TrackerEngine is the class you would like to use. The sequencebelow is enough to start the Tracker:
__label__dc Never include user email addresses in the internal Rails cache.Caches are stored for reuse later, and there's always the risk thatthey will accidentally presented to another user not authorized to see it.Otherwise, please do use caches to speed repeated responses where theymake sense.  Caches are one of the key mechanisms we use to providerapid responses to users.
__label__dc - Strongly prefer the use of unique_ptr over shared_ptr, only use shared_ptr if you absolutely have to
__label__bw View repository:
__label__cf git push origin feature-xxx
__label__sc - If thereand just use the descriptive part: bugfix/fix-typo-in-docs.
__label__dc Error Handling
__label__sc After that Tests should up updated if change affects them, or new Tests could be created.Lastly README should be updated if additional explanations are required regarding the change.
__label__cf - [ ] Add "newSyntax" to parser typings
__label__sc - net or p2p for changes to the peer-to-peer network code
__label__sc 2.  Avoid reformatting existing code unless you are making other changes to it.
__label__sc Your commit history should be as clean as possible:
__label__sc - add new layout helper
__label__dc - Member variables follow lower camel case with a single underscore prefix: _exampleVariable
__label__sc 2.  Reinstall the lib while keeping Git metadata: composer install --prefer-source
__label__tc - Code of Conduct

__label__no Declarative actions: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client object and the ability to perform common actions.
__label__no - If an issue is closed without a fix, because it was a duplicate, or perhaps it was invalid, then any milestone markers should be removed.
__label__no Bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome. When filing a bug, try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:
__label__no Please review these impeccable guidelines.
__label__sc - If your pull request fixes a bug that has been reported or implements a feature that has been requested in another issue, try to mention it in the message, so that it can be closed once your pull request has been merged. If you use special keywords in the commit comment or pull request text, GitHub will close the issue(s) automatically.
__label__no $ npm run commits
__label__no Contributions to documentation are always welcome. Even fixing one typo improves the quality of bootstrap_form. To make a documentation contribution, follow steps 1-3 of Code Contributions, then make the documentation changes, then make the pull request (step 6 of Code Contributions).
__label__dc Compatibility

__label__no - Angular Universal Version - what version of Angular is affected (e.g. 2.0.0-beta.6)
__label__dc Historically we usedjquery-turbolinksto try to make Rails' "turbolinks" mechanism workwith standard JavaScript ready events.Rails' turbolinks gem claims that it"works great with the jQuery framework",but this is misleading.Turbolinks breaks $(document).ready(an extremely common construct)and by default requires you to use a nonstandard on..."page:change".These incompatibilities led to unreliability, particularly on the/project_stats page.We have (for now) abandoned turbolinks, and that made everything reliable.

You can run every part of the function except parts where authentication is required without this secret. If you are working on a part of the function that requires this secret then you can generate one for yourself to test with. Register a GitHub app for development purpose and install this app into the repo you are using to test with. Set the AppId in the code and you should be good to go.

__label__no It is key that staging is deterministic; therefore, a clear definition of override priority isneeded. More specific files will override (overwrite) less specific files when staging. Note herethat FILE may be a file or a directory containing further files.
__label__cf 3.  Use a Linux or Mac computer. Windows might work, but we cannot test that.
__label__sc - More covered below in the Prepare commits section.
__label__dc - No magic numbers, use named constants:

__label__sc Commit squashing
__label__sc Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help.They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.
__label__no Feature requests are welcome.But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

__label__sc Body
__label__bw The basic commands to get the repository cloned and built locally follow:
__label__tc If you have any questions, create an issue (protip: do a quick search first to see if someone else didn't ask the same question before!).You can also reach us at hello@jquery-adaptive-backgrounds.opencollective.com.

__label__cf Contributing Code Changes
__label__no The needs triage and question labels are a good place to find ongoing discussions.
__label__sc Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easierto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
__label__cf - Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
__label__dc - The answer is not more options.  If you feel compelled to exposenew preferences to the user it's very possible you've made a wrongturn somewhere.
__label__ct - Writing unit tests: testing specific sections of the code
__label__sc When you submit a pull request, Altair's continuous integration test suite willrun a number of tests to validate the correctness of your code. It can be helpfulwhen debugging to run those tests locally; to do this first install Altair'sdevelopment requirements:
__label__sc Tips about Pull Request
__label__sc To see the commit that you just made (with author, date, short and longdescription only), use:
__label__no Core development ideas or discussion:
__label__sc - All code must have completed any necessary legal signoff for being publicly viewable (Patent review, JSR review, etc.)
__label__no For other bugs open an Issue at the Issuetracker. Remember to alwaysinclude:
__label__sc If you are requested to make modifications to your proposed changes, make the changes locally on your feature_x branch, re-push the feature_x branch to your fork.  The existing pull request should automatically pick up the change and update accordingly.
__label__no - an explanation of why you should be a committer,
__label__no You can run eng\scripts\Export-API.ps1 and eng\scripts\Update-Snippets.ps1 simultaneously as part of the build by setting as true either:
__label__sc - If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or other target branch in the main project).

__label__dc - Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
__label__no - What did you expect that would happen on your Bolt site?
__label__no Thank you to all the people who have already contributed to BootstrapVue!
__label__no If you find bugs, mistakes, or inconsistencies in this project's code or documents, please let us know by opening a new issue, but consider searching through existing issues first to check and see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.
__label__cf Detailed guidelines on How To Contribute can be found in Apache Ignite wiki
__label__no - It DOES NOT matter how much you change the code.
__label__dc Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage). Please review the Chai.js Coding Style Guide.
__label__sc - don't capitalize first letter
__label__dc 2.  Add your handler in handlers.js

__label__no - Example configuration - show us your full gulpfile.js, Gruntfile.js, bs-config.js or any other code related to how you're usingBrowsersync. If we have to respond to your very first issue report with "please provide information about how you're using Browsersync"then it's very likely to fall to the bottom of the heap. Help us out by providing as much detail as possible!

__label__cf Hard way The best way to contribute is to "clone" your fork of CodeIgniter to your development area. That sounds like some jargon, but "forking" on GitHub means "making a copy of that repo to your account" and "cloning" means "copying that code to your environment so you can work on it".
__label__no - tree-view - file and directory listing on the left of the UI.
__label__sc # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directorygit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name># Navigate to the newly cloned directorycd <repo-name># Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>
__label__bw 2.  Run yarn install

__label__no You can start seeing thedocumentation, andcontact us if you want to helpwritting documentationor recording tutorials.
__label__cf Contributing
__label__sc Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
__label__no To report a bug, use the GitHub issue tracker. Please check the Open issues, and create a new issue if you do not see a report that matches the bug that you have found.
__label__dc - Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
__label__tc - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull requesta look. If you think you've been waiting for an unreasonably long time (say,more than a month) for no particular reason (a few lines changed, etc.),this is totally fine. Try to return the favor when someone else is askingfor feedback on their code, and the universe balances out.
__label__sc Pull Requests

__label__sc Before we can use your code, you must sign the[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own thecopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of ourcodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We alsoneed to be sure of various other thingsknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to signthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member hasapproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch withus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out andpossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoidfrustration later on.

__label__sc If a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to getit to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the TC. TCmembers should regularly discuss pending contributions in order to find aresolution. It is expected that only a small minority of issues be brought tothe TC for resolution and that discussion and compromise among committers be thedefault resolution mechanism.

__label__cf This is generally easier to follow, but separate commits are useful if the Pull Request containsiterations that might be interesting to see side-by-side.
__label__dc Project structure
__label__ct - Making demos and tutorials, blogging about Lucene.Net, etc. (and providing feedback on how we can make the API better!). If you write a helpful Lucene.Net post on your blog, be sure to let us know so we can link to it.

__label__sc 1.  It is a good habit to create a feature request issue to disscuss whether the feature is necessary before you implement it. However, it's unnecessary to create an issue to claim that you found a typo or improved the readability of documentaion, just create a pull request.

__label__sc - Restrict pull requests to one piece of functionality or bugfix at a time.
__label__cf 2.  If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
__label__sc Select what you want to commit
__label__sc libui does not enforce rules about the length or detail that a commit message. I'm not looking for an essay. However, single-word descriptions of nontrivial changes are not acceptable. I should be able to get a glimpse of what a commit does from the commit message, even if it's just one sentence to describe a trivial change. (Yes, I know I haven't followed this rule strictly myself, but I try not to break it too.) And a commit message should encompass everything; typically, I make a number of incremental commits toward a feature, so the commit messages don't have to be too long to explain everything.
__label__no Members can be added to the TC at any time. Any committer can nominate anothercommitter to the TC and the TC uses its standard consensus seeking process toevaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not participateconsistently at the level of a majority of the other members are expected toresign.

__label__no We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Rather thannits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on yourcontribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change(because people don't assume others won't actually like the proposal). Don't takethat personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggestingand see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to thedeveloper notes, is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could givetheir opinion on the concept itself.

__label__no Build tools are now downloaded as part of a nuget package under root\restoredPackages\microsoft.internal.netsdkbuild.mgmt.toolsIf for any reason there is an update to the build tools, you will then need to first delete directory root\restoredPackages\microsoft.internal.netsdkbuild.mgmt.tools and re-execute your build command. This will simply get the latest version of build tools.
__label__no Making changes to the ClosedXML code may change the input or output of the package parts.

__label__no Chart parameters are stored as a JSON encoded string the slices.params column and are often referenced throughout the code as form-data. Currently the form-data is neither versioned nor typed as thus is somewhat free-formed. Note in the future there may be merit in using something like JSON Schema to both annotate and validate the JSON object in addition to using a Mypy TypedDict (introduced in Python 3.8) for typing the form-data in the backend. This section serves as a potential primer for that work.

__label__no We assure you - the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code atall, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open sourceprojects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect codeisn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!); it'strying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from thosemistakes. That's how we all improve, and we are happy to help others learn.

__label__cf 1.  Please include a clear list of what you've done
__label__sc - Explains more fully the reason(s) for the change and contrasts with previous behavior.
__label__sc # Create a new branch for development. The name of branch should be semantic, avoiding words like 'update' or 'tmp'. We suggest to use feature/xxx, if the modification is about to implement a new feature.$ git checkout -b branch-name
__label__sc - Unit test added (prefer not to modify an existing test, otherwise, it's probably a breaking change)
__label__no Never fear! If you occasionally merged upstream/master, here is another way to squash your changes into a single commit:
__label__sc - One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
__label__dc The default 'rake' task and the variant used by ourcontinuous integration (CI) suite includes the rake 'bundle_audit' task.This reports if a Ruby gem we use has a publicly knownvulnerability listed in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).Thus, simply running 'rake' will immediately warn you if there is apublicly known vulnerability in the version of a gem we use.Obviously, if there is a known vulnerability you definitely needto update that gem.

__label__dc Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.

__label__dc Private API names uipriv and be followed by a capital letter. This avoids namespace collisions in static libraries.
__label__sc Since development is a shared branch, it is important not to ever rebase this branch onto master. If a bug fix is applied to master it can be merged into development using good old simple git checkout development && git merge master. Yes this will clutter the history a little bit, but it also provides important context to know how/when a patch was applied. Merge commits can be considered necessary historical data, not warts on an idealized history graph.

__label__sc Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any codechanges to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!
__label__sc If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit <hash>., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
__label__dc - all letters in upper case
__label__no Using CCLIb and CloudCompare database/algorithmsAll algorithms (in CCLib) and 3D entities (in CCLib, qCC_db, qCC_io and qCC_gl) are accessible inside the plugin. Check the doxygen documentation of those projects for more information.

__label__sc Scope
__label__dc Test data files and support files used to generate implementation-specific test files.
__label__no 1.  Ensure the bug has not already been reported by searching the issues
__label__no If you get ENFILE: file table overflow, ENFILE: too many open files or any other ENFILE or EMFILE errors on Mac, that means you are doing synchronous file system operations. Cypress should NEVER do them. Instead we should use async file system operations and let graceful-fs retry them. Find the place where the synchronous fs operation is done from the stacktrace and make it async.
__label__dc - All header files use #pragma once to prevent multiple inclusion.

__label__no - Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
__label__no Contribution Guide
__label__no Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
__label__dc #include "some/other/library.h"
__label__dc - For Ruby gems, look at its data at https://rubygems.org/ to learnmore about it. E.G., is it still actively maintained?(e.g., it uses semantic versioning and have a ChangeLog).
__label__dc - Do not import namespaces in headers (e.g. using std), only in source files
__label__no First, if you're opening a Github issue make sure it goes to the correct repository:
__label__sc - You can stage parts of a file for commit.
__label__sc - During development, you can run grunt test-n-serve.It will start the server and in addition keep a watch for changes torun build/test as needed.
__label__sc Note that a single PR should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changesto a few individual PRs.
__label__no Documentation
__label__bw npm install -g gulp
__label__cf Your effort might be lost if it's already in progress, or if there is a disagreement about approach, etc.
__label__no Crowdin
__label__bw superset/config.py contains DEFAULT_FEATURE_FLAGS which will be overwritten bythose specified under FEATURE_FLAGS in superset_config.py. For example, DEFAULT_FEATURE_FLAGS = { 'FOO': True, 'BAR': False } in superset/config.py and FEATURE_FLAGS = { 'BAR': True, 'BAZ': True } in superset_config.py will resultin combined feature flags of { 'FOO': True, 'BAR': True, 'BAZ': True }.
__label__no Bug reports
__label__dc - AngleSharp uses the RHS convention, where types are always put on the right hand side if possible, i.e., preferring var under all circumstances
__label__sc With that in mind, all new features to Actionhero must also include additions to the test suite to ensure that in the future, we can maintain your work. When writing tests, write the smallest test that ensures that your work is tested. IE: if you write a new initializer, you probably can test the method directly and you don't need an action test or an integration test.
__label__sc - All bug fixes should include a unit test(s).
__label__no - For simple beginner questions, you can get quick answers from
__label__sc git pull --ff upstream master
__label__no - Submitting a Pull Request
__label__no Pull Requests
__label__dc Follow the style used by the .NET Foundation, with a few exceptions:
__label__sc 5.  Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
__label__sc - Rebase often, see below.
__label__sc Finally, go to GitHub and make a Pull Request :D
__label__sc - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
__label__sc License
__label__sc Pull requests are the only way of pushing your code to the master branch. When creating a PR make sure you choose a short but sensical PR title and add a few lines describing your contribution.
__label__no Examples:
__label__no Breaking changes
__label__dc license_finder approval add --who=WHO --why=WHY GEM-NAME
__label__no - Code of Conduct
__label__no First, thank you for considering contributing to react-native-router-flux! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ?
__label__cf 5.  Submit a pull request to https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib
__label__no In order for us to help with an issue, it's useful if you provide as much detail as possible.That starts with a clear descriptive title. It is likely that at any given time there are a number of issues open. A clear title helps us (and others) to easily locate a certain issue.Then provide the steps you took in order to accomplish a certain task. The following can be used as a template for it:
__label__no Check for duplicates, though! When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue.
__label__no - Y is a minor release, which adds both new features and bug fixes
__label__ct Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels ((enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
__label__no Contributing policy
__label__no - RunListener
__label__sc A couple requirements:
__label__no Announcements of releases are made to the chef mailing list when they are available and are mirrored to the #announcements channel on the Chef Community Slack.
__label__no We get a lot of feature requests for Bolt, and we can't do them all, even if wewanted to. In fact, since Bolt is designed to be 'simple, sophisticated andstraightforward', not all feature requests might be a good fit for Bolt. Be sureto read our manifesto to get an idea of ourgoals and values.
__label__sc Every PR should only contain one feature change, bug fix or typo correction.
__label__no Thanks!
__label__sc - fix: A bug fix
__label__no - Blog about Cypress. We display blogs featuring Cypress on our Examples page. If you'd like your blog featured, open a PR to add it to our docs.

__label__dc - Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as atom, remote)
__label__no Contribution guidelines
__label__sc - Run the unit tests and check that they're passing
__label__dc Dependencies for the Cake executable is acceptable in specific circumstances.If you want to introduce a dependency to the Cake executable, make sure you bring itup in an issue or a pull request, so it can be properly discussed.
__label__sc How to submit a contribution.
__label__no Everyone comes in with their own perspective on what a project could/should look like, and encouraging discussion can help expose good ideas sooner.
__label__no Hi! Nice to see you here!

__label__tc We have a code of conduct that we all mustread. Be polite to everyone. If you are not in your best day, take adeep breath and try again. Smile :smile:
__label__sc The first line of commit message should be a one-line summary of the change.A paragraph can be added following the summary to clearly explain the details of the change.If your code fixed an issue, add the issue number to your commit message.An example of a good commit message is:
__label__cf RFC stands for Request for Commits, a standard process followed by many other frameworks including Ember, yarn and rust.

__label__sc 4. Submit a Pull Request
__label__no Examples of spacing
__label__no Feature requests

__label__no They already solved their issue
__label__sc The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer hasan objection. During review committers may also request that a specificcontributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PRcan be merged. There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions toland. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed byany committer.
__label__sc Testing
__label__sc Please try not to submit pull requests that don't add new features (e.g. moving stuff around)unless you see something that is obviously wrong or that could be written in a more terse oridiomatic style. It takes time to review each pull request - time that I'd prefer to spend writingnew features!
__label__tc Project governance
__label__no If you have an idea for something new or would like to improve something. Please open a quick issue explaining the changes and the reasons for them. Everyone's time is important and we don't want you duplicating work someone else might already be working on.
__label__no It's a great idea to read Eric Steven Raymond's How To Ask Questions The Smart Way twice before asking a question. But if you are busy now, I recommend to read Don't post homework questions first.
__label__no - Chris Anderson (@injinj) did amazing work exploring a 128 bit variation and attacking RiskyHash using a variation on a Meet-In-The-Middle attack, written by Hening Makholm (@hmakholm) on his (SMHasher fork). The RiskyHash dfraft was updated to address this attack.
__label__bw It's convenient to link @cubejs-backend/server-core into your project for manual tests of changes of backend code.Cube.js uses yarn as package manager instead of npm.In order to link @cubejs-backend/server-core:
__label__bw - git config core.autocrlf false
__label__dc - types.db: One of the most common mistakes made by new contributors is theaddition of (many) new types in the file src/types.db. The majority ofusecases can be met with one of the existing entries. If you plan to add newentries to src/types.db, you should talk to us early in the designprocess.
__label__no At any point in the release cycle for a new release, there could exist one ormore alpha, beta, or release candidate (RC) release. Alpha, beta, and releasecandidates should not be used in production environments.
__label__dc Don't Reinvent the Wheel! There's an API and defined, easy-to-understand set of methods for a reason - use them.
__label__cf Your First Contribution
__label__dc - If you need to capture the output from a function, store the output usingprintf -v instead if possible. -v specfies the name of the variable intowhich to write the result; the caller can supply this name as a parameter.
__label__tc StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
__label__cf Contributing Workflow
__label__bw Install Redis
__label__no Preparation
__label__sc - Limit the first line to 80 characters or less
__label__no We welcome financial contributions in full transparency on ouropen collective. Anyone can file anexpense.

__label__bw Add upstream:
__label__no Getting Started:
__label__sc The body is mandatory for all commits except for those of scope "docs".When the body is required it must be at least 20 characters long.
__label__sc The script ./link-all.sh can be used to generate symlinks to all modules in this repository under some node_moduledirectory. This can be used to develop against this repo as a local dependency.
__label__no A few tips for reporting conversion issues:
__label__sc Contributor License Agreement
__label__sc You might need to read GIT documentation on how to prepare patchesfor mail submission. Take a look at http://book.git-scm.com/ and/orhttp://git-scm.com/documentation for details. It should not be hardat all.
__label__no - Overview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
__label__bw The image will start and will map the root of the repository to /cypress inside the image. Now you can modify the files using your favorite environment and rerun tests inside the docker environment.
__label__dc There are a few stylistic conventions followed in the code:
__label__dc - Run prettier if you can :)
__label__sc git rebase master -igit push -f
__label__sc - Add accompanying test case.
__label__dc General
__label__no Other resources
__label__sc - a descriptive title; this gets used in the release notes (desktop or android)
__label__no // Lines prefixed with the below comment format will be ignored by the snippet updater./*@@*/ string ignored = "this code will not appear in the snippet markdown";
__label__no The documentation site is built with Gatsby. If you'd like to contribute to thedocs, simply run yarn docs:start.
__label__sc If you have already adopted terms and conditions of the CLA, you are able to provide your contributes. When you submit your pull request, please add the following information into it:
__label__no - A beginner to Catch2, who requires closer guidance for the usage of Catch2.
__label__no Strings are added or removed from localization bundles in the translation filesas needed. Strings MUST NOT be changed after they've been committed andpushed to master. Changing a string requires creating a new ID with a new name(preferably descriptive instead of incremented) and deletion of the obsolete ID.It's often useful to add a comment above the string with info about how andwhere the string is used.

__label__sc - Refer to the issue/s your pull request fixes, so they're closed automaticallywhen your pull request is merged.
__label__no - Use GitHub-flavored Markdown. Especially put code blocks and console outputs in backticks (```). That increases the readability. Bonus points for applying the appropriate syntax highlighting. (Tip: Podfiles are written in a Ruby DSL.)
__label__dc Integrate it into your text editor:
__label__no 5.  git push && git push --tags
__label__tc - Please do not e-mail the project developer directly with questions or issues specific to AzuraCast, unless you were specifically requested to do so as part of an ongoing issue. Contacting me directly prevents me from tracking all outstanding issues in one place, and harms the transparency that is essential to FOSS development. If, however, you are e-mailing me to offer me a paying job...go nuts.
__label__sc - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missingsemi-colons, etc)

__label__sc We require the Ruby code to have at least 90% statement coverage;please ensure your contributions do not lower the coverage below that minimum.The Ruby code uses minitest as the test framework, and we use'vcr' to record live data for replaying later.Additional tests are very welcome.
__label__cf - core/ processes visualization.
__label__dc Please follow the LLVM style standard, in the very least concerning code formatting, indentation, and brace-style. There is a .dir-locals.el file at the Clasp root that should automatically configure the proper rules, if you happen to use Emacs. Otherwise you can run clang-format on your code with the settings from the .clang-format file, which you can find at the Clasp root as well.
__label__cf 4.  Create your own feature branch: git checkout -b proposed-feature
__label__dc We use TSLint with custom configs to keep our code-style consistent.
__label__no Found a post/issue with your exact problem, but with no answer?Don't just leave a "me too" message - provide the details of your case.Problems with more available information are easier to solve and attract good attention.
__label__no Contributions
__label__no The AngleSharp project ultimately tries to provide tools to parse, inspect, modify and interact with traditional web resources, such as HTML or CSS, for .NET development. Anything that is related to this goal will be considered. The project aims to be fully standards compliant. If your contribution is not following the standard, the chances of accepting it are limited.
__label__dc We strongly recommend you use the VSCode text editor since most of our code is written in TypeScript and it offers amazing support for the language.
__label__dc - HTTP / WebSockets:
__label__dc The exception to this rule is for everything in the python_bindings/ package. This package holds the public API for Gooey, and thus honors PEP8. So the general rule is that if you're making a change to the public bindings: use PEP8. For all other internal Gooey code, honor the house style you find.
__label__no - Java styleguide
__label__dc Client side
__label__no - language-javascript - all bundled languages are packages too, and each one has a separate package language-[name]. Use these for feedback on syntax highlighting issues that only appear for a specific language.
__label__tc This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct.By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.Please report unacceptable behavior to abuse@cloudscribe.com.
__label__cf What should I know before I get started?
__label__cf - Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. my-fix-branch).
__label__no - Next, create a new issue that thoroughly explains the problem. Please fill out the populated issue form before submitting the issue.
__label__sc - Limit each Pull Request to one feature.Don't bundle multiple features/changes (e.g. a new Theme and a fix to an existing plugin) into a single Pull Request - create one PR for the theme, and a separate PR for the fix.
__label__cf Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastichelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelatedcommits.
__label__no 3.  It's not something really obvious that you can fix yourself
__label__no If you do these things, it will be make evaluation and acceptance easy. Now if you stray outside of the guidelines we have above, it doesn't mean we are going to ignore your pull request. It will just make things harder for us.  Harder for us roughly translates to a longer SLA for your pull request.
__label__no - This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests across the repositories.

__label__dc - Code should follow pep8, although if you are modifying an existing module, it is more important for the code to be consistent if there are any discrepancies. Using flake8 can assist in identifying pep8 compliance issues.
__label__no This page covers some guidelines and helpful tips for contributingto the codebase itself.
__label__sc Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easierto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
__label__sc The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports,feature requests and submitting pullrequests, but please respect the following restrictions:
__label__no - If you have a question about using ngx-admin, please ask on the StackOverflow.
__label__no - Some issues may need to be uplifted to other channels (Dev / Beta / Release). Please see our notes on uplifting a pull request.

__label__sc 3.  Use Test Driven-Development.
__label__dc Style Guidelines
__label__dc - VSCode: prettier-vscode
__label__sc Feel free to create a pull requestif you think you can contribute to the project. You will be listed as acontributor, agree tothis document, and theLICENSE.
__label__dc 2.  Must respect the tslint.json (yarn lint).
__label__sc Before submitting PR make sure to run yarn on the root of monorepo to ensure that commit lint and husky are installed.
__label__sc - body: A detailed description of changes being made and reasoning if necessary. This may contain several paragraphs.

__label__dc All bug fixes should be sent to the latest staging branch i.e development branch. Bug fixes should never be sent to the master branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.
__label__cf 2.  Create a branch off of gli-2 (master is no longer the canonical branch)
__label__sc - Make sure your patch is well covered by tests. We don't accept changes to Cucumber that aren't tested.
__label__no 1.  How to contribute
__label__sc Subject
__label__sc - Make your changes in a new git branch:
__label__no Pull requests
__label__sc - Reference issues as a PR comment.
__label__no - Best to subscribe to the translation email address
__label__sc Then, we can create the databases (if they don't already exist):
__label__no Support Requests
__label__sc On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a discussion is to send a pull request. Use your judgement!
__label__bw Fork the code if you haven't already done so.
__label__bw git clone https://github.com/checkly/puppeteer-recordercd puppeteer-recorder
__label__dc We have a code style setting for the project (checkstyle for Java, ktlint for Kotlin). Please run Reformat Code in Android Studio (or Intellij) on changed files before pushing them. Alternatively for Kotlin you can use ktlint tasks: check Kotlin code formatting with./gradlew ktlint and reformat all Kotlin code with ./gradlew ktlintformat.
__label__sc - Look at the code coverage report of your branch and attempt to cover all code paths in the fast unit tests. Attempt to trigger exceptions as well. It is acceptable to have some exceptions not triggered (e.g. out of memory exceptions or type switch exceptions), but large branches of code should always be either covered or removed.
__label__sc Please consult the LICENSE file in this project for copyright andlicense details.
__label__sc If your pull request is accepted for merging, you may be asked by a maintainer to squash and or rebase your commits before it is merged.
__label__sc Chef uses the Apache 2.0 license to strike a balance between open contribution and allowing you to use the software however you would like to.

__label__no StackOverflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
__label__no - StackOverflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.
__label__dc - We would ask that contributions conform to our coding standards, and that contributions are fully tested before submission, as mentioned in the Tests and Continuous Integration sections.
__label__dc :param x: A number:returns: The square root of the given number:raises ValueError: If the number is negative"""
__label__dc - All header files must include the directive, "#pragma once".
__label__sc Please commit changes to a separate branch in your forkso that we can work together making changes to it before itis ready to be merged. Name your branch something like<username>/feature.

__label__dc As long as you keep the code readable, I don't care too much about any specific coding convention. There are only a few rules that should be honored:
__label__cf 3.  Perform a Code Review with the project maintainers on the pull request.
__label__tc - StackOverflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.
__label__dc - Reference where that idea/algorithm came from.
__label__sc - Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
__label__no - The hardware must be commercially available and of interest to a wide audience.In other words, ports for bespoke hardware built for e.g. a specific project /a single customer / niche markets are more suitable for a Contiki fork.
__label__sc You must GPG-sign your work, certifying that you either wrote the work or otherwise have the right to pass it on to an open-source project. This is not just a "signed-off-by" commit, but instead, a digitally signed one.
__label__tc - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in aprofessional setting

__label__dc If you reformat code or hit core functionality without an approval from a person on the Chocolatey Team, it's likely that no matter how awesome it looks afterwards, it will probably not get accepted. Reformatting code makes it harder for us to evaluate exactly what was changed.
__label__sc - If contributing new functionality, make sure that you add a unit test for it, while making sure that all previous tests pass. Camelot uses pytest for testing. Tests can be run using:
__label__sc - git push origin your-branch (origin would be your GitHub repo or your-github-username/choco in this case). You may need to git push origin your-branch --force to get the commits pushed. This is generally acceptable with topic branches not in the mainstream repository.
__label__sc Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. Before start working on something make always a search in opened issues and pull requests, this might help you to avoid waisting time.

__label__no - Further Info
__label__sc Plase note that you must adhere to each of the above mentioned rules.Failure to do so will result in an immediate closing of the pullrequest. If you update and rebase the pull request to follow theguidelines your pull request will be re-opened and considered forinclusion.

__label__no The most important things to do are:
__label__cf - For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can bediscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
__label__sc Once the Reactor Engineer handling your pull request is happy with it they will merge it into develop and your patch will be part of the next release.
__label__sc CodeIgniter uses the Git-Flow branching model which requires all pull requests to be sent to the "develop" branch. This iswhere the next planned version will be developed. The "master" branch will always contain the latest stable version and is kept clean so a "hotfix" (e.g: an emergency security patch) can be applied to master to create a new version, without worrying about other features holding it up. For this reason all commits need to be made to "develop" and any sent to "master" will be closed automatically. If you have multiple changes to submit, please place all changes into their own branch on your fork.
__label__sc This helps us out by allowing us to track which issue your commit relates to.
__label__sc - @angular-devkit/schematics
__label__no Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:
__label__sc All Pull Requests must be approved by at least one member of the SDK teambefore it can be merged in. The members only have limited bandwidth to reviewPull Requests so it's not unusual for a Pull Request to go unreviewed for a fewdays, especially if it's a large or complex one. If, after a week, your PullRequest has not had any engagement from the SDK team, feel free to ping amember to ask for a review.

__label__sc 1.  Obtain OAuth2 credentials from Google Developers Console
__label__bw Bootstrapping your local development environment
__label__sc 4.  We separate the core library from add-ons. Consider if your change is really core, or could be shipped as an add-on. Let the user 'buy-in' to your feature over making them take it.
__label__sc Note: Running Catch2's tests requires Python3
__label__no Submission Constraints
__label__bw pip install -e .pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
__label__dc Member fields are to be camel case starting with an alpha character. For the most part people don't write C# in notepad so do not worry about any prefixes with underscores, or special things like b_ or any of that
__label__cf 4.  Target the develop branch for your Pull Requests as this is were new changes are introduced.
__label__dc - For function definitions, place each brace on its own line.
__label__no - ??asm("wfi"); becomes asm ("wfi");: A space gets added before the opening paren, because the asm keyword stops this from getting interpreted as a normal function call / macro invocation. This is only a problem with asm. For instance, ??foo("bar"); gets formatted correctly.

__label__no Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to Word To Markdown. Your help is essential for keeping it great.
__label__sc When you make a pull request please use a clear and descriptive title. Be specific about what's changed and why.
__label__sc We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to morereadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,we use the git commit messages to generate the Kitten Tricks change log.
__label__sc Contributed bash functions are most welcome! The more we share the less weduplicate each other. In order to keep this repo tidy, every function must bedocumented in the readme and tested, the lint scripts enforce these rules.
__label__no - Areas where documentation could be improved

__label__no We are not here to support your individual projects. We depend on you (the community)to contribute in making the tool better for everyone. So debug and reduce your own issuesbefore creating a ticket and let us know of all the things you tried and their outcome.This applies double if you cannot share a reproduction with us because of internal companypolicies.
__label__sc Branches
__label__sc This ensures that your history is "clean" i.e. you have one branch off from dev followed by your changes in a straight line. Failing to do this ends up with several "messy" merges in your history, which we don't want. This is the reason why you should always work in a branch and you should never be working in, or sending pull requests from dev.
__label__sc - git checkout your-branch
__label__sc Changes affecting Bluetooth scanning, addressing device-specific issues often cannot be adequately tested using Robolectric since it stubs out Bluetooth and Android OS system callsChanges of this nature must be manually tested on a physical device. Manual tests should be performed with the library's reference application, if possible.
__label__cf There is a Travis CI running which compiles the code on Linux and macOS. Currently, it is limited to a out-of-sourcebuild. Windows is not supported yet. Please check the Travis CI status for each PR. The macOS build runs the unit tests.Code coverage runs on one of the Linux images.
__label__no 3.  Isolate the real problem — make sure the issue is really a bug inRansack and not in your code or another gem.

__label__cf 3.  If you're submitting a new model / feature / module, please include proper documentation and unit tests.
__label__no The rest of this document is a guide for those maintaining Cucumber, and others who would like to submit patches.
__label__no Scope
__label__no The OpenXML specification is a large and complicated beast. In order for ClosedXML, the wrapper around OpenXML, to support all the features, we rely on community contributions. Before opening an issue to request a new feature, we'd like to urge you to try to implement it yourself and log a pull request.
__label__no - Set up milestone. Confirm that request is related to milestone.
__label__cf In general, PRs are welcome. We follow the typical "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.
__label__no dotnet build eng\service.proj /p:ServiceDirectory=eventhub /p:UpdateSourceOnBuild=true
__label__sc - If your PR addresses an issue, please include "Fixes #NNN" in the summary for the PRso that the issue is linked to the PR (and vice versa) and if/when the PR is merged,the issue is automatically closed.

__label__sc We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to morereadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,we use the git commit messages to generate the Angular Tree Component change log.
__label__ct - reporting an issue
__label__no - It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

__label__no Often, your problem may have a lot in common with other similar problems. If we understand your use case, we can compare it to other use cases and sometimes find a more powerful or more general solution which solves several problems at once. Understanding the root issue can let us merge and contextualize things. Sometimes there's already a way to solve your problem that might just not be obvious.
__label__no Contributing
__label__ct We maintain two labels within our issue tracker that may be of interest to new contributors:
__label__no - [ ] The code works and performs its intended function with the correct logic.
__label__no Sponsors
__label__no Code
__label__cf Project maintainers aim for a quick turnaround on refactoring pull requests, sowhere possible keep them short, uncomplex and easy to verify.
__label__sc 3.  After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing What if the status checks are failing?If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.

__label__no - Example code should not require downloading external datasets. We suggestusing the vega_datasets package if possible.If you are using the vega_datasets package there are multiple ways to referto a data source. If the dataset you would like to use is included in localinstallation (vega_datasets.local_data.list_datasets()) then the data canbe referenced directly, such as source = data.iris(). If the data is notincluded then it should be referenced by URL, such as source = data.movies.url.

__label__no First, in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Bitcoin Coredevelopers" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturallyrevolves around a meritocracy where contributors earn trust from the developercommunity over time. Nevertheless, some hierarchy is necessary for practicalpurposes. As such, there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible formerging pull requests, as well as a "lead maintainer" who is responsible for therelease cycle as well as overall merging, moderation and appointment ofmaintainers.

__label__cf - Start the conversation regarding this defect or feature
__label__sc At this point git rebase will prompt you to choose an action for each commit and resolve any conflicts. You should pick one commit, reword it if necessary and squash the rest. The reason behind using rebase is that it makes for tidier git branching history. Push the rebased PR branch to the remote and you should be good to go:

__label__no Reporting Issues
__label__no - It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.
__label__sc When submitting a pull request (PR), please use the following guidelines:
__label__no Genghis is... a bit weird.
__label__sc Tests go in the ./test directory, as Mocha tests usually do.  They are just a flat list of .js files that Mocha runs.  If your change is a bugfix, please add a test case that would fail without your fix.  If your change is a new feature, please add  tests accordingly.
__label__no To open an issue go to Github Issues.
__label__sc In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be available under the same CC-BY license that covers the project. We also ask all code contributors to GPG sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA.md) to protect future users of this project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
__label__tc To save your and our time, we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests for general support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.
__label__no GitHub issues by-label
__label__sc When you submit a patch or a new functionality for the project, you must open a pull request. We will get to the pull request as soon as possible, investigate what functionality or bug fixes have been added and decide whether to include it in the library or not -- for the benefit of everyone.
__label__dc 3.  Reference the handler in the app.js code.
__label__no - Minor corrections and fixes to pull requests submitted by others.
__label__bw You need to update your local installation of Ruby.This typically happens after you've done a git pull;what has happened is that the Ruby version changed in file .ruby-version.To fix this, just run this command:
__label__no A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository.Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!
__label__sc - Update the type definitions for Flow and Typescript if you changed an API or added a component.

__label__sc - Do not include executable binary files, because they are usuallyrejected for security reasons. Instead, provide instructions for howto compile the file, so that a trusted member of the merge team cancommit it.
__label__bw If you want to test anything other than HTTP, it will require the AzureWebJobsStorage and AzureWebJobsDashboard settings get set to an Azure Storage Account connection string. You'll also need to add settings for any non-storage services you might want to connect to. You can do this via the same 3 methods described above.
__label__cf - Performance improvements: if you are making changes that impact astropyperformance, consider adding a performance benchmark in theastropy-benchmarksrepository. You can find out more about how to do thisin the README for that repository.

__label__no - What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
__label__sc 3.  Ensure local tests pass.
__label__no If the issue can be reproduced in the latest master version, you can help us by submitting an issueto our GitHub Repository. After the issue is triaged(labels are applied to it), we invite you to submit a Pull Request with a proposed fix.Your custom changes can be crafted in a repository fork and submittedto the GitHub Repository as a Pull Request.

__label__sc - If testing against a pre-release (alpha, beta, RC), ensure your tests areperformed against latest version
__label__no If you're an experienced Vagrant user then you can fetch the base box and register it yourself.
__label__dc - Each library component should provide an all.hpp header that contains themain page for the documentation and includes all headers for the user API.
__label__dc - Use # :nodoc: for methods that a user of GLI should not call (but still please do document all methods)

__label__sc Note that in the past, Robo used Codeception / Aspect Mock etc. in its unit tests. These components proved to be difficult to maintain when testing on mutiple PHP versions, so they were removed. The tests formerly in tests/cli were all ported to straight phpunit tests in the tests/integration directory. Some of the unit tests from tests/unit were ported to tests/phpunit; however, a number of tests that still use AspectMock still exist in tests/unit, although these are not currently being used.

__label__sc - git merge --squash <current-feature-branch>
__label__sc Before submitting changes, you mustrun 'rake' (no options) to look for problems,and fix the problems found.In some cases it's okay to fix them by disabling the warning in that particularplace, but be careful; it's often better to make a real change,even if it doesn't matter in that particular case.
__label__no - For more complicated questions, you can use Google or StackOverflow. Make sure to provide enough information when asking your questions - this makes it easier for others to help you!

__label__ct It is normal for a first pull request to be a potential fix for a problem, and moving on from there to helping the project's direction can be difficult. We will try to help contributors cross that barrier by offering good first step issues. These issues can be fixed without feeling like you are stepping on toes. Ideally, these are non-critical issues that are well defined. They will be purposely avoided by mature contributors to the project, to make space for others.

__label__sc - Discuss review comments and iterate until you get at least onesame branch. Usually all these are going to be squashed when you merge to master. The commit messages should be hintsfor you when you finalize your merge commit message.
__label__cf Security and bug fixes can be backported from master to releasebranches.If the backport is non-trivial, it may be appropriate to open anadditional PR to backport the change, but only after the original PRhas been merged.Otherwise, backports will be done in batches andthe maintainers will use the proper Needs backport (...) labelswhen needed (the original author does not need to worry about it).
__label__dc - Do not assume any specific properties based on the choice of struct vs class; always use <type_traits> to check the actual properties
__label__cf Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

__label__no Requesting new features
__label__sc There are currently a few exceptions to the "use package name" rule:
__label__bw Build the project (fast build).
__label__cf You may find the documentation in DESIGN.md and the source codehelpful.

__label__no This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source codeheld within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would beextremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.
__label__cf - Changelog entry: whether you are fixing a bug or adding newfunctionality, you should add an entry to the CHANGES.rst file thatincludes the PR number. If you are opening a pull request you may not knowthe PR number yet, but you can add it once the pull request is open. If youare not sure where to put the changelog entry, wait until a maintainerhas reviewed your PR and assigned it to a milestone.
__label__no Discussion of issues should be placed transparently in the issue tracker here on GitHub.

__label__sc Submitting Changes
__label__no That's essentially it.
__label__sc - no dot (.) at the end
__label__sc - Your PR branch should be based off a recent commit of the develop branch. Preferably the base commit for the PR should use the latest commit of develop at the time the PR was created. This helps to ensure there are no merge conflicts or test failures when the PR is merged back to the develop branch.
__label__sc - Make sure your commit messages follow the seven rules of a great git commit message:

__label__sc - Send a Pull Request, see https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests to the dev branch.
__label__sc - For example, you can use npm test -- -R spec to use the spec reporter, rather than the dot reporter (by default, the test output looks like a bunch of dots)
__label__dc - Many others
__label__no <url> - a link to the reduced test case
__label__no If you make public API changes or additions, the eng\scripts\Export-API.ps1 script has to be run to update public API listings. This generates a file in the library's directory similar to the example found in sdk\template\Azure.Template\api\Azure.Template.netstandard2.0.cs.
__label__sc - Send us a pull request.
__label__dc constexpr const char default_name[] = "my object";
__label__cf - If someone else is already working on the suggestion, then hopefully you can collaborate with them.

__label__cf You can also amend the initial commits and force push them to the branch.
__label__no The TC uses a "consensus seeking" process for issues that are escalated to the TC.The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among TC members.If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then a majority wins voteis called. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the TC are viaa consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.
__label__no 5.  Run you code to make sure it works. If you're still having problems please try to run make clean and then test your code again.
__label__sc If you simply fork the repo and then create a PR from it, your PR will fail the submit-coverage check on CI. This is because the 0x CircleCI configuration sets the COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN environment variable to the token for 0xProject/0x-monorepo, but when running the check against your fork the token needs to match your repo's name your-username/0x-monorepo.
__label__cf We want to accept your pull requests. Please follow these steps:
__label__tc - Use the #atom channel for general questions or discussion about Atom
__label__no 3.  Each shipping package contains a project for their generated and /or Customization code
__label__no We also accept suggestions for new features or missing capabilities as GitHubissues. The most important aspect of a suggestion issue is to provide as manydetails as possible about your use case and less focus on the solution. Itis usually possible to support different use cases in many different ways, andwe need to understand the motivation before we dive into a solution.

__label__sc 2.  Create a feature branch
__label__no In any source file, a special variable in the form __ENV_[ENV_VAR]__ can placed. Once all filesare staged, the __ENV_[ENV_VAR]__ variable will be replaced with the raw contents of theenvironment variable named ENV_VAR. Only environment variables with all-caps, underscores, anddigits are supported. Staging will report an error if an environment variable's value is unset.

__label__no The only case where it is legitimate to break a public API is if the existingAPI is a bug that blocked the usage of a feature. This means that by breakingthis API we will not break anyone, because they weren't able to use it.

__label__sc - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
__label__dc Here are a couple rules of thumb regarding how to pass around these shared_ptr objects:
__label__dc - using C++ in ui_windows.h (this file should still be C compatible)
__label__bw Hit F1, type > TypeScript: Restart TS Server.
__label__no As the creators and maintainers of this project, we want to ensure that the project lives and continues to grow. Not blocked by any singular person's computer time. One of the simplest ways of doing this is by encouraging a larger set of shallow contributors. Through this, we hope to mitigate the problems of a project that needs updates, but there is no-one who has the power to do so.
__label__sc - Test your changes.
__label__sc The release process is fairly well automated. You do need publishing rights to the npmjs.combookshelf package and write access to the GitHub repository. Once that's setjust make sure to follow the process explained below in the correct order.
__label__bw Now go open your favorite web browser on you host machine and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
__label__dc - Maintain the existing coding style. There are some settings in .jsbeautifyrc to help.
__label__no 4.  You can now submit this new branch and create or replace your existing pull request.
__label__sc If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header ofthe reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit <hash>., where the hash isthe SHA of the commit being reverted.

__label__dc - TSLint
__label__no 1.  Define a new const undercx-api/lib/features.tswith the name of the context key that enables this new feature (forexample, ENABLE_STACK_NAME_DUPLICATES). The context key should be in theform module.Type:feature (e.g. @aws-cdk/core:enableStackNameDuplicates).
__label__no - bump version
__label__no Questions & Help
__label__no - Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
__label__no Running the example
__label__sc - We will check your commit message, if it does not conform to the specification, the commit will be automatically refused, make sure you have read the specification above.

__label__cf 2.  If you have changed the workflow, update the documentation.
__label__sc - Squash commits Often we create temporary commits like "Started implementing feature x" and then "Did a bit more on feature x". Squash these commits together using interactive rebase. Also see Squashing commits with rebase.
__label__sc git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
__label__sc - be concise and direct
__label__bw Alternatively, if you want to avoid installing the build tools, there is another script that uses a docker container to build. Just replace build.sh by docker-build.sh:
__label__no When reporting a bug, you should provide as much relevant informations as possible. This includes (but is not limited to):
__label__cf 4.  Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) tocontain your feature, change, or fix:

__label__dc Accessibility, security, and modern best practices are very important in AzuraCast's development. As of this document's latest update (January 2018), we are using PHP 7.2 on all platforms, so any newly contributed code can, and should, take advantage of the full suite of new features made available in PHP 7.0 and newer.
__label__cf - It's worth checking first to see if someone else has raised your issue. We might have responded to them, or someone might be fixing it.
__label__cf When authoring new features or extending existing ones, consider the following:
__label__no - New features that would make Capistrano even better
__label__sc - Please do rewrite PR history to be clean rather than chronological. Within-PR bugfixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc. should be squashed and should not appear in merged PR history.
__label__sc Type
__label__ct Please note that any PR must be associated with a valid issue. Otherwise the PR will be rejected.
__label__dc Some hints about using code from other authors
__label__sc - Node Version: Travis CI runs the tests against all major node versions. If your tests use JavaScript features unsupported by lower versions of node, then use minNodeVersion option in options.json.
__label__sc - Continuous integration status for Windows: Build status on AppVeyor
__label__sc Add something about PRs here, indicate that PRs should not bump the version number & the build output files (c3.js, c3.min.js, c3.css & c3.min.css) should be excluded

__label__sc Review
__label__ct - Code: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
__label__sc 4. Create A Pull Request
__label__dc - resolve include (the below merge is temporary just to resolve the includes)
__label__no Quick Guidelines
__label__sc - Change-type: At least one of your commits on a PR needs to have this tag. You have the flexibility, and it's good practise, to use this tag in as many commits as you see fit; in the end, the resulting change type for the scope of the PR will be folded down to the biggest one as marked in the commits (major>minor>patch). Our version numbering adheres to Semantic Versioning.
__label__cf 5.  Make sure your code lints.
__label__no - See our translations and login via GitHub or others to add yours.
__label__no - Describe your proposed solution?
__label__dc Work on your pull request
__label__no Most of the development process is described in confluence, which services the contributors of Weex and is transparent to all users.
__label__cf There are three categories of refactoring: code-only moves, code style fixes, andcode refactoring. In general, refactoring pull requests should not mix thesethree kinds of activities in order to make refactoring pull requests easy toreview and uncontroversial. In all cases, refactoring PRs must not change thebehaviour of code within the pull request (bugs must be preserved as is).
__label__sc - Please submit all pull requests (except for hotfixes) to the develop branch.
__label__no - https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2012-06/msg00068.html
__label__no - Try to search for your issue before you commit an issue. It may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
__label__sc - none/empty string: useful for style, test and refactor changes that are done across all packages (e.g. style: add missing semicolons)
__label__sc If you need to change the test suite, explain in the commit message why itneeds to be changed (e.g., the page layout or the authentication methodsfrom coursera changed, or they implemented a new kind of course).
__label__sc - We maintain a high percentage of code coverage in our unit tests. As a general rule of thumb, code changes should not lower the overall code coverage percentage for the project. In practice, this means that every bug fix and feature addition should include tests.
__label__tc Hang out in our chat

__label__sc Here's how to make a pull request...
__label__sc You can open an issue and request a new feature. Please add some information on what you would like, how it should work. Small features can be added directly as a Pull Request without opening an issue first.
__label__dc The project currently has the following limitation that might be addressed in the future:
__label__no We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.
__label__no After shipping a release of Chef we bump the Minor version by one to start development of the next minor release. All merges to master trigger an increment of the Patch version, and a build through our internal testing pipeline. We do a Minor release approximately every month, which consist of shipping one of the already auto-incremented and tested Patch versions. For example after shipping 12.10.24, we incremented Chef to 12.11.0. From there 18 commits where merged bringing the version to 12.11.18, which we shipped as an omnibus package.
__label__no Designing a new qCC plugin
__label__dc To start the debugging in Chrome DevTools, open the given URL.The debugger starts at the first executed line of code, which is Mocha's first line by default.Click Resume script execution  to jump to the set breakpoint.Note that the code shown in Chrome DevTools is compiled code and therefore differs.
__label__sc Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not There are currently a few exceptions to the "use package name" rule:
__label__tc New features should have a "sponsor" on the core-team. You are welcome to, ask aspecific team member to sponsor your work (ask around on Slack or IRC), or we'll tryto match someone to your feature based on their area of expertise.
__label__bw .\build.sh --target Package
__label__tc - Public or private harassment

__label__bw Depending on your choice of protocols: (this will take a while to run so you may want to grab some coffee)
__label__sc - don't capitalize first letter
__label__no We will try to enforce these rules as we consider the forum is a better place for discussions and learnings.
__label__cf 2.  Follow the appropriate contribution workflow
__label__sc Offhand, it is easy to imagine that this would make code quality suffer, but in reality it offers fresh perspectives to the codebase and encourages ownership from people who are depending on the project. If you are building a project that relies on this codebase, then you probably have the skills to improve it and offer valuable feedback. At the end of the day, there isn't too much risk in this, as the master branch is still locked, and jcenter access is still being restricted.
__label__no 5.  If your Issue does not exist yet, open a new Issue and give it a short descriptive title.
__label__sc 5.  Create a Pull Request from your branch
__label__dc See our C# Coding Style for more information on following the project's conventions.
__label__sc Then run phpunit:

__label__no - A list of things which are not meant to work, if any
__label__dc Within the Web/ directory you will see the following key files
__label__no - You can also try build.debug.bat - note that it is newer and it may have an issue or two. It doesn't require --allow-unofficial-build as the binaries are built for debugging.
__label__sc Commit Message Format
__label__no We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by open a new issue.
__label__sc - If you are new to writing commit messages in git, follow the guide here.
__label__sc 2.  Add BATS tests for all new top level functions
__label__no - Open Source License
__label__ct - Write test cases for open bug issues
__label__no Creating a new language dictionary
__label__no - if ((a == 1) && ((b == 2) || (c == 3))) instead of ambiguous if (a == 1 && b == 2 || c == 3)
__label__sc In many cases this is because you need to forcibly precompile the assets;just run this:
__label__bw bundle install
__label__no - Configure a results backend, here's a local FileSystemCache example,not recommended for production,but perfect for testing (stores cache in /tmp)
__label__dc Connecting React components to Redux
__label__bw - For that, you will need to download git-clang-format from here or here.
__label__sc 9.  Wait for a committer to commit your patch.  You can nudge the committers if necessary by sending a message to the Apache Thrift mailing list.
__label__no Thanks! ??????
__label__sc - Make a Pull Request to dev_for_new_features this branch not to master so that master branch can only have stable changes.
__label__cf 3.  External API changes and significant modifications ought to be subject to an internal pull-request to solicit feedback from other contributors.
__label__sc - Open all pull requests against the develop branch.
__label__sc - While not an absolute requirement, automated tests will help reviewers feel comfortable about your changes, which gets your contributions accepted faster.
__label__dc # runs an npm script via lerna for a the current modulealias lr='lerna run --stream --scope $(node -p "require(\"./package.json\").name")'

__label__sc 9.  Set up git hooks by running ./scripts/setup-git-hooks and commit your work.  This will ensure that the same set of testsas ./scripts/test run as a pre-commit hook before any commit.
__label__no Labels on issues are managed by contributors, you don't have to worry about them. Here's a list of what they mean:
__label__dc Compatibility
__label__no 2.  A coding style that the other core committers find simple, minimal, and clean.
__label__no To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for generalsupport and redirect people to the section you are reading right now.
__label__cf - Fork the Atomic Game Engine Github repository and make your changes.  Use a well named topic branch for the changes, preferably with uppercase and dashes, use your initials at the beginning of the branch name e.g. JME-EDITOR-FIXES.  Fork off the master branch.  Avoid forking from repository work branches as they may get rebased.

__label__dc For single line conditional statements we do not have any brackets, just the line. Preferrably we put the code on the line following the if statement but for simple things like a return a single line is acceptable
__label__no :clock1: On first load, you will likely see this message: "No results or none that match your search within your time range." This is because the data that was loaded is from all time ranges, so make sure you search for ALL times ranges.
__label__sc - run the bash script tests in tests-ng directory
__label__bw 5.  Install the dependencies and development tools:
__label__no We appreciate that. But before you do, please learn our basic rules:
__label__no Note: We accept bug fixes much faster into our development branch than new features.
__label__sc Note: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

__label__sc Commit Convention
__label__no Search through other issues to see if there is already a previous issue for the bug. Provide a small reproduction using a StackBlitz project or a GitHub repo.
__label__no Documentation is very valuable to us.
__label__cf Here are some resources to get you started:
__label__sc - Commit title and message (and PR title and description) must adhere to conventionalcommits.
__label__sc Make a Pull Request
__label__sc Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:
__label__sc Open Source License
__label__no Before submitting a bug report, please do the following:
__label__no - rubocop - runs Rubocop, which checks Ruby code style against thecommunity Ruby style guide
__label__no To encourage active collaboration, Bagisto encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing negative test.
__label__sc For most packages there are typically unit and some integration tests.
__label__cf 2.  Create the corresponding issues.
__label__sc Pull requests that fail to meet these requirements may be summarily closed without response.
__label__sc Patchsets should always be focused. For example, a pull request could add afeature, fix a bug, or refactor code; but not a mixture. Please also avoid superpull requests which attempt to do too much, are overly large, or overly complexas this makes review difficult.
__label__tc Our Standards
__label__sc - feat: A new feature
__label__bw Example Gemfile.local:
__label__no - What actually occurred
__label__no To see all labels and their meanings, check this wiki page.

__label__no Let us know what motivates you!
__label__cf 3.  Do the changes in your fork
__label__no BEFORE:
__label__tc - Public or private harassment
__label__no We ask you not to submit security concerns via GitHub. For details on submitting potential security issues please see https://www.chef.io/security/
__label__cf The best way to see a feature added, however, is to submit a pull request.
__label__no Feature Requests
__label__sc - Make granular and atomic commits, e.g. do not mix a typo fix with some major refactoring
__label__no - docs
__label__cf This is especially important if you want to implement new feature.
__label__dc CodeIgniter recommends PHP 5.5 or newer to be used, but it should becompatible with PHP 5.2.4 so all code supplied must stick to thisrequirement. If PHP 5.3 (and above) functions or features are used thenthere must be a fallback for PHP 5.2.4.

__label__no Please follow the below points:
__label__no Introduction
__label__sc Type
__label__no 3.  Upgrade the DB
__label__sc Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:
__label__sc Before the pull request is merged, make sure that you squash yourcommits into logical units of work using git rebase -i and git push -f. After every commit the test suite should be passing. Includedocumentation changes in the same commit so that a revert would removeall traces of the feature or fix.

__label__sc - rpc, rest or zmq for changes to the RPC, REST or ZMQ APIs
__label__no Please, before sending patches, read these brief comments. They are here tohelp the project have both its users happy using the program and thedevelopers/maintainers feel good when trying to change code that otherpeople contributed.

__label__no """body is the content of the CommentRevision. If null, it indicates that thebody text was deleted."""body: String}
__label__dc - chocolatey.console is the project you are looking to run.
__label__no It is therefore critical that any code change that affects the public-facing API go through a full  swift-evolution review process. This gives us the chance to ensure several important requirements are satisfied:
__label__no We look forward to reviewing your PR!
__label__sc - Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

__label__sc We may ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for larger changes.
__label__no Submissions will be considered for submission (or removal) on a case-by-case basis.
__label__no Process: Your own code changes
__label__cf 4.  Clone your forked CodeIgniter repo: git@github.com:/CodeIgniter.git.
__label__sc Note that most, if not all, of us do this in our free time, so sometimes you get a quick response and in other times it may take longer. You should also be willing to update your code if one of the collaborators think it's needed.We assume that you've read GitHub's help page regarding pull request.
__label__no 5.  If you have some other ideas, please let us know!
__label__bw UI-Router uses npm and Rollup.
__label__sc Any code change should be submitted as a pull request, based on develop branch. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.
__label__no - If you're reporting that AdAway crashed, include a logcat.Use adb logcat if you have developer settings enabled on your device or use any application like CatLog to save logs.Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.
__label__cf The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyonewithout exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests" (PRs). Thisfacilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.
__label__sc - Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

__label__sc A goal of this project is to be accepted into the .NET Foundation. Probably this will only be possible if/when this project becomes popular. However, it will be a goal to transfer copyright ownership of all project code for all of the cloudscribe projects to the foundation. This means that to contribute any code to this project, you must also be willing and able to transfer copyright ownership of any code you submit to this project so that we will have the ability to later transfer it to the .NET Foundation.

__label__sc Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
__label__sc If you want to launch Behat tests for MongoDB, the command is:
__label__sc - Open a pull request to the original repository and choose the right original branch you want to patch.
__label__cf 4.  Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate:./bin/phpspec run --format=pretty
__label__sc - Make changes in your separate branch.
__label__no - If the issue is a duplicate, please let the issue creator know in a polite way how they can follow and track progress of the parent issue (including an ETA if it's marked with a milestone).
__label__dc - Use Google C++ Style   as basic guidelines of C++ code
__label__dc - dictparser.py: abstract class for parsing dictionaries
__label__no - Tooling
__label__dc To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:
__label__no - Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
__label__sc Our integration tests also utilize snapshot testing. To update integration test snapshots, run:
__label__dc void setObject( const ObjectRef &object );
__label__sc - Identity of QA responsible for feature testing (can be conducted post-merging of the pull request).

__label__sc 5. Make pull request, get a review, and merge.
__label__no Please do not raise a pull request directly. There may be reasons why we will not add every feature to this library.
__label__sc - [ ] Title and Description
__label__bw IDE setup
__label__sc Any code pushed to GitHub as part of a Pull Request will automatically trigger a continuous integration build on Travis CI, where the test suite is run on both Linux and macOS.The Pull Request will then show the result of the Travis build, indicating whether all tests ran fine, or whether there were issues.Please pay attention to this, Pull Requests with build issues will not be merged.
__label__no Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already existdocumenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, itnever hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This willhelp prioritize the most common problems and requests.
__label__no Filing Issues
__label__no - Whether you are using Ransack through another gem like ActiveAdmin,SimpleForm, etc.
__label__sc All ChaiScript commits are run through a large set of builds and analysis on all supported platforms. Those results are posted on thebuild dashboard. No PR will be accepted until all tests pass.
__label__sc - Have tests that require an optional dependencybeen marked as such?
__label__no - aframe-site
__label__no 2.  Navigate to repository root directory
__label__no - Creating tracking issues for an area of work with multiple related issues is helpful.
__label__sc - Re-run the Angular Material test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
__label__sc - Avoid merge commits in your PRs. If you want to pull in the latest changes from the develop branch, rebase on top of the develop branch instead of merging the develop branch into your feature branch.
__label__dc 1.  Every feature in vim-anywhere should be cross platform (OSX & Linux at least). I usually won't merge changes unless they're cross platform.

If you want to contribute even something trivial please do not hesitate, but follow the guidelines below.
__label__no Golden rules
__label__no - It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.
__label__bw Create a new factory named VisitFactory and add this definition:
__label__sc Integration tests perform a few functions in the CDK code base -
__label__bw We use Appraisal to test against multiple versions ofRails, so you can read up on that and use it to test against all the Railsversions we support or against a specific one.
__label__dc For stability we set fixed version numbers for Ruby and the Ruby gems.
__label__dc - Class Layout: Start out with a public block containing the constructor and public variables, followed by a public block containing public methods of the class. After that follow any private functions and private variables.
__label__dc npm run build:demo
__label__sc Pull Request Guidelines
__label__sc Ensure all your code is thoroughly tested and that this testing is detailed in the pull request.
__label__sc Submit a pull request
__label__bw 3.  Continue running commands in the botpress terminal window
__label__no 1. I'm reporting a bug
__label__sc 8.  Run Cloud Foundry Acceptance Tests (CATS).  We recommendrunning the tests as a bosh errand (bosh run errand acceptance_tests). You won't see any output from the testsuntil the errand completes.  If you choose to run them manually, please follow the instructions in theCATS README.

__label__no To give a bird's eye view of the release cycle,
__label__sc To facilitate this check, after creating your fork, but before creating the branch for your PR, do the following:
__label__sc Type
__label__sc - There is an options.json file whose function is similar to a .babelrc file, allowing you to pass in the plugins and settings you need for your tests.
__label__no Security issue notifications
__label__dc There is a tool called Cane that allows you to validate your code's ABC complexity and documentation.
__label__sc 4.  Begin by running the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests,and it's great to know that you have a clean slate:
__label__no Pull request????????
__label__sc Testing
__label__no Etiquette
__label__dc - Must have documentation: C++ APIs must use Doxygen strings, tools must have a README.md file that describe how to use the tool
__label__no You can use find-cycles to print a list of internal dependency cycles:
__label__sc - You are making commits in a feature branch.
__label__dc - Exceptions: Quotes are not required within math contexts, i.e. (( )) or$(( )), and must not be used for variables on the right side of the =~operator.
__label__no Got a Question or Problem?
__label__bw AngleSharp itself does not have dependencies, however, the tests are dependent on NUnit.
__label__sc The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For examplemenu, sidebar, etc.
__label__no - If you're unable to find an open issue that relates to your problem, open a new one. Please be sure to follow the issue template as much as possible.
__label__no To contribute to the guide or quick start docs, make your changes to the appropriate .pug files in the docs directory of the master branch and submit a pull request. Again, the Edit button might work for you here.
__label__cf - Be detailed; refrain from mentioning code problems without sharing your source code and always give information regarding your board and version of the library
__label__sc Changes generally should not break the existing API and should be backward compatible with the current release version If the PR does represent a breaking change, the title or description must make this clear. Breaking changes will be held for the next major version release of the library.
__label__sc git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
__label__sc - commit and push with [ci skip]
__label__dc - Make an effort to follow the overal coding style, which is roughly based on the Qt Creator coding style.
__label__dc - When specifying @param, also specify if the argument is optional. Present an indented description on the next line, and also specify its default value if applicable.
__label__sc When you want to create a pull request, the best way to do that is by creating a topic branch, branched off of either v1.1.x or v1.2.x according to the criteria outlined above, preferably with a name describing what the branch is about. When you're writing the code for your pull request, we prefer smaller (atomic) commits over 1 commit with a lot of 'unrelated' changes.Each commit should have a clear message saying what has changed. If you want to provide more context to your commit, that's an excellent candidate for the second line of your commit message.An example is the following commit: Add filesystem packages so fsck can be run from initramfs.

__label__no Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessaryinformation to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.
__label__no Despite AzuraCast's growing popularity, we almost never receive pull requests from contributors wanting to add functionality or resolve issues with our application's code. Don't let this discourage you, though; we highly encourage skilled developers to contribute their expertise to our codebase whenever possible.

__label__cf Adding a feature
__label__sc - docs: Documentation only changes
__label__no We're happy you want to contribute! You can help us in different ways:
__label__dc - We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
__label__cf - Check out the Babel Plugin Handbook - core plugins are written the same way as any other plugin!
__label__dc - No underscores for anything. (Yes, I know Bindings violates this principle, but that's for legacy reasons and really should be cleaned up some day)

__label__no Thank you to all our backers! [Become a backer]
__label__sc The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
__label__no When including packages in your examples (even the package you're writing theexamples for), use the full package name (e.g. import s3 = require('@aws-cdk/aws-s3);). The example will be compiled in an environmentwhere all CDK packages are available using their public names. In this way,it's also possible to import packages that are not in the dependency set ofthe current package.
__label__dc - Add yourself as an @author to the .java files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
__label__dc - Put spaces after commas. Vector3d(1, 2, 3) instead of Vector3d(1,2,3)
__label__dc Code Guidelines
__label__sc - Brief description of the changes between old and new versions of the pullrequest. If there were more than one previous pull request, all therevisions should be listed. For example:
__label__cf The configuration files are divided in config/, config/advance/ and config/custom
__label__cf I'd also recommend getting your editor set up nicely to handle TypeScript,Prettier, and Mocha.
__label__sc You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do itagain.

Here's a great article about why writing about your experience is important; this will encourage other beginners to try their luck at Open Source, too!
__label__sc - The message of the commit should be prefixed by the name of the file which isthe main focus of the patch enclosed by square brackets (.e.g. [Installer] install pods).
__label__no Why do we give out push access?
__label__dc 2.  Everything should work out of the box by running the install script.
__label__no Hi there, and thanks for your interest in the C# ALGORITHMS repository. This document serves as a set of general guidelines for open-source contribution.
__label__no This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source codeheld within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would beextremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.
__label__dc In all cases, you should not commit the installed 3rd party libraries into the project. The README document will provide all the steps anyone would need to compile the library on their machine.
__label__dc To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:
__label__no We use Github Issues to track public bugs and feature requests.
__label__dc - Exception: If the string contains an apostrophe, use double quotes.
__label__dc - The code should be secure, and will be reviewed from a security point of view as well.
__label__no - Welcome!
__label__no - Setup Environment
__label__dc Process substitution
__label__no - Please check Copay logs (General Settings -> About Copay -> Session Logs). Look forany errors reported there (errors are shown in red)
__label__dc - Go to your <clone location>/.git/hooks folder, create a text file named "pre-commit" there with the following contents:
__label__no Contributing to Chef Projects
__label__no Licensing
__label__no - brunch/init-skeleton helps you create new Brunch apps.It uses the list of skeletons from brunch/skeletons
__label__sc - Keep branches small so that completed and working features can be merged into the "dev" branch often, and so that they can be abandoned if they head in the wrong direction.
__label__no - For pages with more than 4 subheadings, we provide a table of contents(ToC) at the top of the page. Because GitHub markdown does not supportautomatic generation of ToC, it has to be handled semi-manually. Thus,if you've added a new subheading to some page, you should add it to theToC. This can be done either manually, or by running theupdateDocumentToC.py script in the scripts/ folder.
__label__cf - Fork the repo.
__label__no - Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
__label__no Please open an issue on atom/atom if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
__label__bw It is possible (but not usually necessary) to build container images directly from staging in theevent that make build is not appealing. Simply stage the flavor(s) to be built, and then executethe desired build command for daemon-base and daemon.

__label__cf 2.  Fork the repository on GitHub.
__label__cf 7. Done!
__label__cf How to get started
__label__no Steps to take during Code Review
__label__ct - Code Review onPull Requests.This is one of the most valuable ways to contribute, because it helpsto improve code and features, and helps to find bugs, before the codegets merged. A little bit of time investment from just a few people oneach pull request goes a long way to increasing the quality of thefinal product. For tips on how to participate in pull requests pleaseview theREADME.md.
__label__no Since the birth of CapRover, there has been many contributions and suggestions that shaped CapRover as we know it today. One of the very important factor in the contribution you make is to stick with CapRover design philosophy.- CapRover is not an enterprise grade application like Kubernetes. Do not patch it with half-done features that make it look like one - it will eventually fail as we don't have resources to support such features.- CapRover scope is a helper around Docker, nginx and Let's Encrypt.

__label__dc Normal .NET coding guidelines apply.See the Framework Design Guidelines for more information.
__label__sc - Focus on one thing only. Each PR should avoid making unrelated changes - those makes the history more difficult to understand later on, and they make the review a headache.
__label__sc Have a new feature? You can start off by writing some tests that detailthe behaviour you want to achieve and go from there.
__label__bw Running the tests is the best way to ensure you have correctly set up your development environment. Make sure you're in the cherow directory and run:
__label__tc - Join the Gitter room and feel free to askquestions or discuss anything.
__label__dc Try use similar coding standards to what you see in the project to keep things clear to the contributors. If you're unsure, it's always a safe bet to fall-back to the PSR standards.
__label__tc Please don't cross post.  The same people are monitoring the forum and Stack Overflow.  Duplicate posts won't get your question answered faster.
__label__cf Unsure where to start? Issues marked with up for grabs are things we want help with.

__label__dc The helpers/utility functions that are available to the packages are what we consider the API. If you are working in the API, please note that you will need to maintain backwards compatibility. If you plan to rename a function or make it more generic, you must provide an alias in the chocolateyInstaller.psm1 as part of what gets exported. You should not remove or reorder parameters, only add optional parameters to the end. They should be named and not positional (we are moving away from positional parameters as much as possible).

While this capability is one of Bash's core strengths,every new process created by Bats makes the framework slower, and speed iscritical to encouraging the practice of automated testing. (This is especiallytrue on Windows, where process creation is one or two orders of magnitudeslower. See bats-core/bats-core#8 for an illustration ofthe difference avoiding subshells makes.) Bash is quite powerful; see if youcan do what you need in pure Bash first.
__label__dc Committers will rotate reviewing the code to make sure all the PR will be reviewed timely and by at least one committer before merge. If we aren't doing our job (sometimes we drop things). And as always, we welcome volunteers for code review.

__label__tc So you want to contribute something to Catch2? That's great! Whether it'sa bug fix, a new feature, support for additional compilers - or justa fix to the documentation - all contributions are very welcome and verymuch appreciated. Of course so are bug reports, other comments, andquestions, but generally it is a better idea to ask questions in ourDiscord, than in the issue tracker.

__label__sc However, not all tests can be written as plain unit tests. For example,checking that Catch2 orders tests randomly when asked to, and that thisrandom ordering is subset-invariant, is better done as an integrationtest using an external check script. Catch2 integration tests are writtenusing CTest, either as a direct command invocation + pass/fail regex,or by delegating the check to a Python script.

__label__no Security issue notifications
__label__dc - Formatting should be done with pre-commit, otherwise the format check will not pass. However, it is trivial to apply this to your PR, so don't worry about this check. If you do want to run it, see below.
__label__no - Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
__label__sc You can run yarn commit and follow the instructions, or use VSCode Conventional Commits extension in VSCode.
__label__sc - Don't worry about updating CHANGELOG.md or .semver.  The package administratorwill handle updating those when new releases are created.
__label__cf - Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
__label__no - Aim for 100% test coverage and covering corner cases
__label__sc - git checkout develop

__label__sc - Create a new feature branch. It's important that you do your work on your own branch and that it's created off of dev. Tip: Give it a descriptive name and include the issue number, e.g. implement-testkits-eventfilter-323 or 295-implement-tailchopping-router, so that others can see what is being worked on.

__label__no Contributions to this project are released to the public under the project's open source license.
__label__cf 3.  You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
__label__no When reporting issues, please try to be as descriptive as possible, and includeas much relevant information as you can. A step by step guide on how toreproduce the issue will greatly increase the chances of your issue beingresolved in a timely manner.
__label__dc There is a small amount of application-specific client-side JavaScript;by convention custom client-side JavaScript is in "app/assets/javascripts/".
__label__no Adding a new datasource
__label__no Ensure that each pull request meets all requirements in checklist.

__label__sc 1.  Fork the project
__label__bw Go to https://nodejs.org/ to download and install the latest stable version for your operating system.
__label__sc - don't capitalize first letter
__label__sc - Increment the pkgrel variable by a decimal number if the version of the package is already in the package repositories.  This is to prevent interference tracking against upstream versions.  For example:
__label__no - You'll find on each component under src/main/docs an .adoc file
__label__no - Set it for the milestone where it makes the most sense
__label__sc - If pkgrel=1, change to pkgrel=1.1
__label__bw You will want to fork the Clasp repository, clone that to your machine and set up the upstream remote using git remote add upstream https://github.com/drmeister/clasp. While developing you should periodically synchronise your fork with the upstream as otherwise things can get too out of sync to still be mergeable. In case of updates from upstream, you should pull those in using git pull --rebase upstream dev while on your local dev or feature branch. Only create merge commits if there is a conflict; we'd like to keep a somewhat clean history.
__label__sc Please follow the provided PR template when writing a description for your changes.
__label__cf and resolve the conflicts. After resolving conflicts, push your branch again:
__label__no - This can be handled nicely in our resolvers. We simply check if the retrieved values is null or undefined and simply return an empty array in its stead.
__label__sc - Tests should be hermetic. Tests should not depend on external services.
__label__sc - No unnecessary whitespace. Check for whitespace with git diff --check and git diff --cached --check before commit.
__label__sc - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.
__label__dc Do not use incompatible Java features (java.util.function, java.awt).
__label__dc Development Guidelines

__label__dc Master
__label__no - The first comment in an issue ideally would have a clear description of the issue and describe the impact to users. Asking folks for screenshots, steps to reproduce, and more information is highly recommended so that the issue is as clear as possible.
__label__dc If you do plead your case, keep in mind that "it's old" is not a sufficient reason to drop things. If you can prove that virtually no one uses the minimum version anymore, then that is stronger evidence. The best evidence, however, is that not upgrading will hold libui back in some significant way

__label__bw We also have support for running with VS Code. You will still need to get the CLI as mentioned above and the C# extension for VS Code in order to compile and get intellisense.Each function has a task you can execute that will clean + build + run the process. To start one open the prompt with cmd/ctrl + shift + p and select Run task. From there you will see all the tasks checked into .vscode/tasks.json. Choose a function to run such as Run CompressImagesFunction and it will build and start up. To attach to this process choose the Debug a function configuration from the debug tab to see the running processes. Type func into the picker to see your running function and select it. It's a two-step process, the debugger and the function process. When you kill the debugger, the process will still be running. You can kill the function host by bringing up the prompt again with cmd/ctrl + shift + p and select Kill the active terminal instance.

__label__sc - Update README.md if required.
__label__ct Here is some inspiration on which areas we would love to have some contributions:
__label__no If you encounter a bug, it's entirely possible that it has already been fixed but not yet included in a released version. You can establish this by trying to run your application with a pre-release version of Celluloid direct from source control. You can do this by modifying your application's Gemfile as follows:
__label__bw from console_log import ConsoleLog
__label__bw Follow the installation instructions for your platform on the Vagrant download page.

__label__ct - Alternatively, if a feature is on the issues list with the Up For Grabs label, it is open for a community member (contributor) to patch. You should comment that you are signing up for it on the issue so someone else doesn't also sign up for the work.
__label__no - Check to see if there's an existing issue/pull request for the bug/feature. All issues are at https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues and pull reqs are at https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/pulls.

__label__no If you want to become a trusted translator in a locale we don't already support,there are a few steps we have to take to add the locale.In particular, we need to know the locale code.If the language is not written left-to-right (e.g., Arabic and Hebrew),there are some additional steps we will need to take.And of course, you need to convince us that you'll produce trustworthytranslations, because others are counting on you.
__label__no We reserve the right to publish emergency patches within 24 hours after a release if a tag that does not respectthis pattern would have been released despite our vigilance. In this very rare and particular case, we would mark thetag as broken on GitHub and backward compatibility would be based on previous stable tag.

__label__sc Contributor License Agreements
__label__sc A few little tips with pull requests:
__label__sc - the resulting code uses the MIT license, listing me (and only me) as the author. You can take credit by stating that the code was written by yourself, but should attribute copyright and authorship to me (Boaz Segev). This is similar to a "work for hire" approach.
__label__no Want a Feature?
__label__cf Contributions to blazingSQL fall into the following three categories.
__label__no This library is the culmination of the expertise of many members of the open source community who have dedicated their time and hard work. The best way to ask for help or propose a new idea is to create a new issue while creating a Pull Request with your code changes allows you to share your own innovations with the rest of the community.
__label__no Pull Requests
__label__no - Troubleshooting
__label__sc - Share the reason behind your changes
__label__sc Patches submitted in issues, email, or elsewhere may be ignored.
__label__sc You report will be placed to htmlcov directory. Please do not include this directory to your commits. By default this directory in our .gitignore file.
__label__dc Following our coding conventions
__label__sc Body
__label__no Contributing Guidelines
__label__bw cd <root>yarn start
__label__no This package is versioned under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.
__label__cf Bug fixes & "mini" features
__label__no This is extremely important for narrowing down the cause of your problem.
__label__dc - Use AtomDoc.
__label__cf The codebase is maintained using the "contributor workflow" where everyone without exception contributes patch proposals using "pull requests".This facilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.
__label__sc Testing
__label__tc - Site Feedback: A category for discussing the forums and the OSS project, its organization, how it works, and how we can improve it.
__label__sc - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
__label__bw - git config merge.log true
__label__tc Our Gitter room: https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel.
__label__no * Register a service with CoreServiceProvider.
__label__dc Follow the Intellij's code style helpto import and set up the style. Make sure to activate the AzkabanStyle by"copy the IDE scheme to the current project, using the Copy to Project... command."
__label__dc Naming
__label__bw Setup instructions
__label__dc - We follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide, but wrap all code at100 characters.
__label__bw 2.  Run the following command from the root of the project:
__label__bw # Alternative: Build with disabled cachebundle exec rake 'docker:build[false]'
__label__dc Code review
__label__no - Help solve problems with the issues
__label__no - Git Commit Messages
__label__tc Please avoid emailing maintainers found in the MAINTAINERS file directly. Theyare very busy and read the mailing lists.
__label__no If you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.
__label__no Designing a new plugin is an easy way to extend qCC (CloudCompare) functionalities, without the pain of having to modify its core and do all the connections.One can easily design a new function, that may be applied on one or several entities currently loaded in CloudCompare. Moreover, the plugin can display its own dialog.A dummy plugin structure (the sources and the corresponding Code::Blocks project) is provided as a template.
__label__cf Development workflow
__label__cf If you are improving the quality of code, then justify/state exactly what you are 'cleaning up' in your Pull Request so as to save reviewers' time.
__label__sc Running Tests
__label__no The current version of the project is mastered in the root lerna.json file. All otherpackage.json files use 0.0.0. This allows bumping a new version withoutneeding to modify multiple files and avoid merge conflicts in post-release rebases.
__label__cf 2.  For pull requests, please make sure all commits are atomic (i.e., one feature per commit)
__label__dc Get the style right
__label__sc Structuring Commits
__label__dc - Use the override keyword wherever possible and omit the keyword virtual when using override.
__label__no Contributing
__label__no """actionCounts stores the counts of all the actions for the CommentRevisionspecifically."""actionCounts: ActionCounts! @auth(roles: [MODERATOR, ADMIN])
__label__cf 5.  Create a pull request explaining your change
__label__sc CodeIgniter4 uses the Git-Flow branching model which requires allPull Requests to be sent to the "develop" branch; this is where the next planned version will be developed.The "master" branch will always contain the latest stable version and is kept clean so a "hotfix" (e.g. anemergency security patch) can be applied to the "master" branch to create a new version, without worryingabout other features holding it up. For this reason, all commits need to be made to the "develop" branch,and any sent to the "master" branch will be closed automatically. If you have multiple changes to submit,please place all changes into their own branch on your fork.
__label__cf We love pull requests and if a contribution is significant we tend to offerpush access. We suggest you take a look at our Contributing guide for info on development setup, and some of our best practices.
__label__cf Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:
__label__sc Additionally, the botocore package is developed in lockstep with the CLI.
__label__no - Client and server side
__label__sc Sign the CLA
__label__sc Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
__label__no The easiest way to get started would be to adapt examples from the Vega-Liteexample gallery which are missingin the altair gallery. Or you can feel free to be creative and build your ownvisualizations.
__label__sc - It passes our continuous integration tests (See: Enabling code coverage checks on your fork for instructions on getting the submit-coverage test to pass on forks)
__label__sc - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts. [2]
__label__cf 2.  All bug fixes that correct a defect that is also present in an LTS branch must be backported to that LTS branch. If a bug fix introduces a change to the API such as a new function, the fix should be reworked to avoid the API change. API changes without very strong justification are unlikely to be accepted.
__label__no - Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
__label__cf - Interpreting JSON in any application-specific way. While in the past I've allowed a few feature additions that attempt to interpret JSON (such as recognizing and linkifying URLs), I want JSONView to be a general JSON viewer, and as such will reject any patch that seeks to priviledge specific interpretations of JSON structure.
__label__sc - Provide a more detailed description containing_ What you want to achieve_ What you changed_ What you added_ What you removed

__label__sc - Run make jstest or make pytest to run style checks, and to generate and run tests.
__label__sc 2.  Create a new branch and merge these commits into one
__label__sc - Before creating your pull request, it's usually worth asking if the codeyou're planning on writing will actually be considered for merging. You cando this by opening an issue and asking. It may also help give themaintainers context for when the time comes to review your code.
__label__cf - [ ] Implement parser plugins based on the new AST. The parser plugin name should be the unprefixed slug of the TC39 proposal URL in camelcase, i.e. exportDefaultFrom from https://github.com/tc39/proposal-export-default-from.
__label__no 3.  Update CHANGELOG.md, increment version, put what you've added to thechangelog into commit message. This way it gets it way into releases pagewith a nice description of the changes.git add ... & git ci -m 'Bump version (old_version -> new_version)'
__label__dc Code is automatically checked for style by Github Actions as part of the automated tests. You can also run these tests yourself by running pre-commit run --all.

__label__no public partial class FileSharesClient{public FileSharesClient(string subscriptionId, TokenCredential tokenCredential): this(subscriptionId, tokenCredential, StorageManagementClientOptions.Default){}
__label__dc This project uses lerna and utilizes symlinks inside nested node_modules directories. You may encounter an issue duringindexing where the IDE attempts to index these directories and keeps following links until the process runs out ofavailable memory and crashes. To fix this, you can run node ./scripts/jetbrains-remove-node-modules.js to excludethese directories.

__label__dc In Ruby,prefer symbols over strings (especially as hash keys)when they do not potentially come from the user.Symbols are typically faster, with no loss of readability.There is one big exception:Data from JSON should normally be accessed with strings,since that's how Ruby normally reads it.Rails normally uses the type ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess,where the difference between symbols and strings is ignored,but JSON results use standard Ruby hashes where symbols and strings areconsidered different; be careful to use the correct type in these cases.
__label__cf 2.  You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
__label__no Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines.The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

__label__bw Windows
__label__bw $ git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk.git$ cd aws-cdk
__label__cf 5.  Make your changes in a new git branch:
__label__dc Code style
__label__tc - You agree to follow the etiquette regarding communication.
__label__sc - ...
__label__ct - beginner: One of our most important kinds of issues! These issues have been marked by the maintainers as small, low-impact changes and fixes, ideal for those just dipping their toes for the first time into the world of contributing to Open Source software. These are by no means any less important than any other issues! We'd appreciate if our more experienced contributors would leave these to our newer compatriots so we can be as fair as possible to everyone.
__label__sc - To help with that, do all your work in a feature branch (e.g. feature/my-alsome-feature).
__label__dc - Be consistent, even when not sticking to the rules.
__label__no - Some more guidelines on filing good bug reports:
__label__sc - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
__label__no About to create a new Github Issue?
__label__no The wiki Home page has several examples of excellent bug reports.  You should review one or two of these for tips on how to file a bug report.
__label__no Work on the code
__label__dc - The last parameter in every function must be [parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments = $true)][Object[]] $ignoredArguments. This allows for future expansion and compatibility - as new parameters are introduced and used, it doesn't break older versions of Chocolatey.
__label__tc - Callstack Open Source Discord - #linaria.
__label__sc 1.  Fork the repository.
__label__bw Now that you are running the service locally, within the root of the repo you will see the following directories:
__label__dc - Create a new folder under packages/, name it as your add-on name.
__label__sc git commit -a
__label__sc When you create a pull request, the template will describe the requiredcomponents needed for it to be reviewed by a member of the Coral team. Youshould end up filling out:
__label__no How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
__label__sc - To help with that, do your work in a feature branch (e.g. feature/my-alsome-feature).
__label__no We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our open collective.Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.

__label__cf The other place where you can tune is to implement the IIntervalAlgorithm. An implementor can controll atwhich rate the peers should request an Announce or Scrape. Currently we have an static implementationwhich uses static defaults taken from the original BitTorrent implementation. It's even possible to higherthe intervals based on the number of peers using the Torrent.

__label__cf Development Guide
__label__ct Finding contributions to work on
__label__no Bug Fixes:
__label__sc After your pull request is merged
__label__sc - Grant APIs (only if not based on official documentation with a reference)
__label__sc Basic Checklist:
__label__cf - If you are a new Camel rider and would like to help us, you can also find some easy to resolve issues.
__label__sc We strongly encourage using the --force-with-lease option instead of --force when performing git push to a repository. The reason is that git push --force can accidentally overwrite work that has been pushed by a team member in the meantime.
__label__no - dev: The dev working branch of master, which is 6.x
__label__sc After your pull request is merged
__label__no - Python Testing
__label__no Imgbot locates all the images that are to be sent through the optimization routine with file directory access against a local clone.
__label__no - If possible, add a logfile to your post. This is especially useful if the bug makes the application crash. AntennaPod has an export logs feature for this.
__label__sc - All commits should have a subject and a body
__label__no - Errors in the service paginators, waiters, or resource JSON definitions. These are also found inapis. We can take contributions directly to these filesas pull requests. If you have a question, please feel free to open an issue.
__label__sc - :bangbang: NEVER commit code that you didn't personally write.
__label__dc - p for Player
__label__dc Running the tests using rake (with no args) will also check for style issues in the code. Ideally all submissions would pass these checks. If the code style is causing issues (particularly the method or class size) we can work with you to correct it. Don't let it stop you from contributing.
__label__sc Pull request guidelines
__label__no ???????????
__label__sc git checkout master -f
__label__sc You should write a test for every data structure and algorithm you implement. The test should be created under the UnitTest project and in the corresponding packages:
__label__sc - :memo: :memo: when writing docs
__label__sc The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.
__label__no - Write a clear and concise summary. Be specific about what component of the software you are writing about, and follow the convention: "Copter: blah blah blah"
__label__sc The design of our automated test suite is to get the testing framework out of the way and make it easy to swap out should it ever need to be (the former is the important goal). We test behaviors of the system, which doesn't simply mean ensuring code coverage. It means we want to see how the system behaves under certain behaviors. As you may see from looking over the tests, we have an interesting way of setting up our specs. We recommend importing the ReSharper templates in docs\resharper_templates. This will make adding specs and new spec files quite a bit easier.
__label__sc If any of the tests fail, update your code until all tests pass.
__label__bw ###Automatic buildYou can build automatically after a file change using the following command:
__label__sc $ cmake --build debug-build
__label__sc In the release of every stable version, there will be a PM who has the following responsibilities in different stages of the release.
__label__no - Want to paste some code or output? Put ``` on a line above and below your code/output. See GFM's Fenced Code Blocks for details.
__label__no - If applicable, the exception stacktrace.
__label__sc bin/rake local console
__label__sc - If we suggest changes then:
__label__cf - What problem are you solving?
__label__sc 5.  Commit your changes (make sure your commit message concise)
__label__no SomeClass::SomeClass( int var1, int var2 ): mVar1( var1 ), mVar2( var2 ){if( var1 == var2 ) {someMethod( var1, Rectf::zero() );}else {......}}
__label__no Feature Flags
__label__dc - Indent using two spaces.
__label__no * regarding copyright ownership.  The ASF licenses this file
__label__no - You are using 32-bit Wine 2.20-staging
__label__sc - Update version number in the docs table at the top
__label__sc Sample applications, if needed, should be modified as well.
__label__cf - If you will be submitting a pull request, fork the repository on GitHub.
__label__sc - Descriptive commit messages If a commit's message isn't descriptive, change it using interactive rebase. Refer to issues using #issue. Example of a bad message ~~"Small cleanup"~~. Example of good message: "Removed Security.Claims header from FSM, which broke Mono build per #62". Don't be afraid to write long messages, if needed. Try to explain why you've done the changes. The Erlang repo has some info on writing good commit messages.
__label__cf We welcome feedback with or without pull requests. If you have an idea for howto improve the project, great! All we ask is that you take the time to write aclear and concise explanation of what need you are trying to solve. If you havethoughts on how it can be solved, include those too!
__label__sc - Make sure to update the PR title/description if things change. The PR title/description are going to be used as thecommit title/message and will appear in the CHANGELOG, so maintain them all the way throughout the process.
__label__sc See https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote for more info
__label__sc Once your changes are ready to be reviewed, publish the branch to GitHub andopen a pull requestagainst it.
__label__no Additional Resources
__label__sc - Keep formatting changes in separate commits to make code reviews easier and distinguish them from actual code changes.
__label__no - Contributing
__label__no If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Including an issue reproduction is the absolute best way to help the team quickly diagnose the problem. Screenshots and error stack traces are also helpful.

__label__no Developing
__label__no Submission Guidelines
__label__cf Don't hesitate to talk about features you want to develop by creating/commenting an issuebefore you start working on them :).
__label__dc Clear and concise communication is essential in keeping the code readable for everyone. Since comments are the main method for communication, please follow these guidelines for commenting the code:
__label__sc ?4?body
__label__sc - Push to a GitHub fork or to a branch (naming convention: <user>/<feature-bug-name>)
__label__no To save your and our time we will be systematically closing all the issues that are requests forgeneral support and redirecting people to StackOverflow.
__label__no If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to ourGitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
__label__sc Creating/Running Tests
__label__no Examples of all packages are extracted and compiled as part of the packagingstep. If you are working on getting rid of example compilation errors of asingle package, you can run scripts/compile-samples on the package by itself.
__label__tc Please be considerate towards others and respect all who participate in the community.
__label__sc 2.  In the branch you do work specific to the feature.
__label__sc Branch Name
__label__sc Running the Tests
__label__tc - Focusing on what is best for the community
__label__cf Check the architecture doc.
__label__sc To run tests in a specific file (e.g., test_dgp.py), use
__label__no - Overview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
__label__cf Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:
__label__sc - Be able to automatically and correctly increment the semver version number based on what was done since the last release.
__label__sc 7.  Open a pull request detailing your changes. Make sure to follow the template
__label__dc - New APIs MUST be easy to use, familiar to cocos2d-x users
__label__no - Bug Reports
__label__no - General GitHub documentation
__label__no 3.  Have a clear and general purpose keyboard story for any feature request
__label__ct The issue tracker has a list of items that you can start working on, classified by the labels:

__label__tc - You agree to follow the code of conduct.
__label__dc How is the codebase organised?
__label__no The list below are guidelines to use when submitting pull requests. These are the same set of guidelines that the core contributors use when submitting changes, and we ask the same of all community contributions as well:
__label__sc - If you need to merge develop or master into your patchset,instead of merging please use git rebase.
__label__no 2.  Label it with Doxygen @since tag, indicating the version it was introduced.
__label__bw npm run dev
__label__no TSC voting members consist of committers that have been nominated by the committers, with a supermajority of voting members required to have a committer elected to be a TSC voting member. TSC voting members term and succession is defined in the charter.

__label__sc - Documentation: If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated as part of the same PR. Doc string are often sufficient, make sure to follow the sphinx compatible standards.
__label__dc - Each class has its own pair of header and implementation files and therelative path for the files are derived from the full class name. Forexample, the header file for caf::example::my_class of libcaf_example islocated at libcaf_example/caf/example/my_class.hpp and the source file atlibcaf_example/src/example/my_class.cpp.

__label__sc - If your PR changes any behavior or fixes an issue, it should have an associated test.
__label__sc - Before making any pull request discuss about the change in a New Issue.
__label__no So all decisions are pull requests, and the relevant maintainer makesthe decision by accepting or refusing the pull request.  But how do weidentify the relevant maintainer for a given pull request?

__label__no Furthermore, it helps if you provide the configuration files you used, such as installer-config.txt. Make sure to remove/replace sensitive information, if present. The installer also creates a log file, which is either located in /boot/ or when the installation finished, in /var/log/. If you can provide those, that helps too.

__label__sc - For individuals we have a simple click-through form.
__label__dc Other Notes
__label__no That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
__label__sc - Ensure your commit messages are well-written. This can double as yourpull request message, so it pays to take the time to write a clear message.
__label__tc - Post snippets of your code using GitHub gists
__label__no Please read the documentation carefully before asking any questions.
__label__sc Running tests
__label__tc We welcome contributions through pull requests on GitHub and encourage contributors to join our IRC channel on freenode, #polr

__label__cf You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHubRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue witha proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. Angular 2 is in developer previewand we are not ready to accept major contributions ahead of the full release.Please consider what kind of change it is:
__label__dc Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).
__label__dc - Avoid i, j, etc. in nested loops. Prefer to use e.g. column_idx, check_idx. In a non-nested loop it is permissible to use i as iterator index.
__label__dc Coding Rules
__label__sc $ git checkout -b issue1234
__label__sc Must be one of the following:
__label__no - Step 2: Find the MAINTAINERS file which affects this directory. If the directory itself does not have a MAINTAINERS file, work your way up the the repo hierarchy until you find one.
__label__dc 3.  Name driver class and adjust package.json, README.md accordingly.

__label__cf Additional Resources
__label__sc - Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
__label__sc Please refrain from creating several pull requests for the same change.Use the pull request that is already open (or was created earlier) to amendchanges. This preserves the discussion and review that happened earlier forthe respective change set.
__label__dc - Consider the semantics of a metaprogramming function. For example,std::conditional is an if-then-else construct. Hence, place the if-clauseon its own line and do the same for the two cases.
__label__sc - test: Adding missing tests
__label__cf You can always send pull requests to the Github repository.
__label__sc Also, run ./gradlew check locally to make sure that style checks and tests pass.
__label__sc You are encouraged to use angular commit-message-format to write commit message. In this way, we could have a more trackable history and an automatically generated changelog.
__label__no A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.
__label__sc - Follow the Angular Coding Rules.
__label__no It is important to note that this is for house cleaning purposes, rather than for shrugging off issues. Cooperation is requested.
__label__sc If you modified the public API, the test will fail. To update the golden files you need to run:
__label__no Before opening a new issue, first check that there is not already an open issue or Pull Request that addresses it.

__label__no then wrap our translatable strings with it, e.g. _('Translate me').During extraction, string literals passed to _ will be added to thegenerated .po file for each language for later translation.
__label__no Please note: support is not offered from the project maintainers through GitHub. Paid support is available by purchasing a license. You may submit support requests in a GitHub issue to see if someone in the community is able to offer help or advice. Support issues will be automatically closed after 7 days to keep the size of the issues list down.

__label__no Thanks! :heart:
__label__dc It's important to try to stay relatively up to date.However, it's usually not possible to keepeverything perfectly up-to-date, becausedifferent gems' specifications forbid it.Also, the Ruby ecosystem is fairly fast-moving,so it doesn't take long at all for even a direct dependency to go out of date.In short, it's normal to have some gems that are not the latest.The key is to replace gem versions that have security vulnerabilities,and to not get too far behind, because if it's too far back then it'sharder to update.If you are very far behind, it may be better to update in stages(using intermediate versions), but avoid needing to do that.
__label__tc We encourage you to ask for help at any point. We want your first experience with Jetpack to be a good one, so don’t be shy. If you’re wondering why something is the way it is, or how a decision was made, you can create an issue and prefix it with “Question:”.
__label__no It isn't wise to build something that can be a part of someone's ecosystem without help, and we are always open to contributions to help us fix issues or work on features

__label__no - Prerequisites
__label__cf Install the necessary dependencies (you can use npm or yarn):
__label__dc GTK+ versions are harder to drop because I am limited by Linux distribution packaging. In general, I will consider bumping GTK+ versions on a new Ubuntu LTS release, choosing the earliest version available on the major distributions at the time of the previous Ubuntu LTS release. As of writing, the next milestone will be after April 2018, and the target GTK+ version appears to be 3.18, judging by Ubuntu 16.04 LTS alone. This may be bumped back depending on other distros (or it may not be bumped at all), but you may wish to keep this in mind as you write.
__label__bw Setting up Your Local Dev Environment
__label__sc 2.  Click the new button called 'Compare & pull request' that showed up just above the main area in your forked repository
__label__bw Installation from Source
__label__dc - write new entries (dotfile, profile) into the dictionary and save it to a file
__label__no 1.  Scan through the listoffeature requests.If you find your feature there, mark it +1. This is a good indication ofinterest from the community.
__label__no - If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been reported. You can search through existing issues to see if there is a similar one reported. Include closed issues as it may have been closed with a solution.
__label__cf To get a sense for the packages that are bundled with Atom, you can go to Settings > Packages within Atom and take a look at the Core Packages section.
__label__sc ?5?footer
__label__dc When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it in the atom/design-decisions repository. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is not documented there, please open a new topic on Discuss, the official Atom message board and ask your question.
__label__dc - All methods that do not modify internal state should be const. All function parameters passed by pointer or reference should be marked const unless they are output parameters.
__label__bw On OSX the easiest way is probably by using PosgresApp. It should also be available toinstall via homebrew or MacPorts if you prefer.
__label__cf - Testing framework hosted at Jenkins.
__label__sc - refactor: code refactor, e.g. new folder structure for components.
__label__cf Getting Started
__label__no We welcome users' contributions! However, we do have some requests for how contributionsshould be made. Please read these guidelines in order to avoid surprises down the road.
__label__dc Contributors should reformat their code similarly before submitting code tothe project, in order to minimize merge conflicts with other work.
__label__sc 2. Manual tests:
__label__sc Please test with the latest Ruby 2.2.x version using RVM if possible.
__label__dc - Use Markdown instead of Doxygen formatters.
__label__no - Direct support for a library that falls under one of the above - When wewant access to a smaller library as an implementation detail for ahigher-priority library we plan to release, we may release it, as we didwith portions of absl/meta/type_traits.h. One consequence of this is thatthe presence of a library in Abseil does not necessarily mean that othersimilar libraries would be a high priority.
__label__no - Issue Reporting Guidelines
__label__sc git checkout mastergit pull upstream master
__label__sc Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easierto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
__label__no The following information is incredibly helpful when raising issues:
__label__cf - Adding new MIME types to the set supported by JSONView. I have an open issue for how I'd like to see additional MIME types handled, and will not accept patches that add arbitrary new MIME types.
__label__bw The testing takes a few minutes to complete. If some tests fail, that likely means one or more parts of the environment setup didn't complete correctly. The upstream tests always pass.
__label__no This section guides you through submitting a bug report for the library. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.
__label__sc - Check out the master branch:
__label__no 1.  Open Developer Command Prompt
__label__sc 6.  Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
__label__sc - No unnecessary whitespace. Check for whitespace with git diff --check and git diff --cached --check before commit.
__label__sc When using Atom, if you edit some of our tests, atom will remove the whitespace on some lines. Unfortunately we wanted this whitespace toable to test multiline commits and their difference across operatingsystems. Atom has decided to keep the stripping of whitespace as adefault. Although we understand this decision, it has the unfortunateside effect of editing parts of the file that you might not haveintended. We think this should be left up to more configurable toolslike eslint.
__label__ct - Code: take a look at the open issues. Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
__label__sc Running Individual Tests
__label__no Security Issues
__label__cf 3.  You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

__label__no - Not Actionable - Need Info: Your issue is not specific enough, or there is no clear action that we can take. Please clarify and refine your issue.
__label__dc - match the existing indentation level
__label__sc - When there are updates made to the original by someone other than the original contributor.Then the old branch is closed with a note on the newer branch this supersedes #github_number.
__label__no - Monitor email aliases.
__label__sc Pull requests are reviewed as and when the maintainers have the time, however, we may have feedback. Try not to take this as a personal criticism but just an attempt to maintain the quality of the project.
__label__dc - Naming conventions for classes, functions, types and files should adhere to CamelCase and specify what the function does.
__label__bw Clone your fork and set up your environment for development. I reccommend iterm, but use whatever you'd like.
__label__no Thank you!

__label__no Issues
__label__dc - Atom: linter-tslint
__label__sc - All commits must be atomic. This means that the commit completely accomplishes a single task. Each commit should result in fully functional code. Multiple tasks should not be combined in a single commit, but a single task should not be split over multiple commits (e.g. one commit per file modified is not a good practice). For more information see http://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits.
__label__tc The following quote sums up the Code Of Conduct.
__label__dc - No dead or commented code in the master branch, unless it is instructive to include it and not distracting for readers. Experimental or unfinished code belongs in development branches.
__label__dc - Max number of columns are 132, please format your code accordingly
__label__no Long term support

__label__no Bug Reporting
__label__no - Check the debugging guide. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Atom, if the problem happens when you run Atom in safe mode, and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.

__label__cf 5.  Work in your feature branch.
__label__sc To isolate your change, please avoid working on the master branch. Instead, work on a feature branch (often also known as topic branch). You can create a new branch (example here crash-fix) off the master branch by using:
__label__sc - Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
__label__sc All new features have to be covered by unit tests.

__label__sc git push my-fork --delete my-fix-branch
__label__sc - Checkout a new topic branch from master branch, and merge back against master branch.
__label__no Submit a suggestion here
__label__ct - wontfix: This means that, after considering your issue in full, your issue is outside of the intended scope of the project and is not something we'd like to add to the codebase right now or in the future. These are used sparingly and are intended to be rare, and are never used without reasoned justification.
__label__no - Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
__label__no - Write some documentation or improve our existing docs. Know another language? You can help us translate them. See our guide to contributing to our docs.
__label__sc 3.  Related Testing: Briefly descirbe what part of testing is relevant to your modification.
__label__sc When you're sending a pull request:
__label__no You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHubRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue witha proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.Please consider what kind of change it is:
__label__no - Related Issues - has a similar issue been reported before?
__label__bw Cube.js works with Node.js 8+ and uses yarn as a package manager.
__label__cf Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that theproject's developers might not want to merge into the project.
__label__sc Commits should be small and atomic. A commit is atomic when, after it isapplied, the codebase, tests and all, still works as expected. Smallcommits are also prefered, as they make later operations with git history,whether it is bisecting, reverting, or something else, easier.
__label__bw - Windows 10 (suggested)
__label__dc - Enum values should be named with UPPER_UNDERSCORES.
__label__bw You can also run algorithm-visualizer in Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub.

__label__bw brew updatebrew install git postgresql
__label__bw $ bundle install
__label__sc Especially if you modify something existing, be very clear! Have you changed any algorithms, or did you just intend to reorder the code? Justify why the changes are needed.
__label__sc - One package per request. PRs must be for a single package only.  A PR addressing multiple packages without merit risks having a delayed merge or being closed.
__label__no Versioning
__label__sc git push --force-with-lease
__label__sc - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
__label__no TL;DR; Tests, coverage, linting, changelog (See Pull Request Requirements, below).
__label__sc - It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on your branch - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
__label__sc 2)  https://yandex.ru/legal/cla/?lang=ru (in Russian).

__label__no - Encourages contributors to remain involved.
__label__dc As more and more modules were introduced to AWS Amplify, it became necessary to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward-compatible to avoid breaking changes.
__label__sc 3.  title is a brief summary of changes.

__label__sc Scope
__label__cf If you intend to work on the code and provide patches and other work you want to submit to the Apache Camel project, then you can fork the project on github and work on your own fork. The custom work you do should be done on branches you create, which can then be committed and pushed upstream, and then submitted to Apache Camel as PRs (pull requests). You can find many resources online how to work on github projects and how to submit work to these projects.

__label__cf - Using Github
__label__no Cytoscape.js is an open source project, and we greatly appreciate any and all contributions.
__label__sc This project has [commitlint][https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint] configuredto ensure that commit messages are of the expected format.To enable commitlint, simply run npm install from the root directory of the KSQL repo(after [installing npm][https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm].)Once enabled, commitlint will reject commits with improperly formatted commit messages.
__label__sc - If you are resolving a special issue, add (fix #xxxx[,#xxx]) (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899).
__label__sc Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any codechanges to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!

__label__no Before filing an issue:
__label__no - This file contains a static part and a dynamically generated part: the former can be edited directly in the .adoc file, while the latter needs your intervention on the javadoc
__label__cf The best way to see a feature added, however, is to submit a pull request.
__label__no Adding a new flavor name like mimic,centos,7 is enough to create a new mimicCeph release.
__label__no Contributing
__label__cf Additional Resources
__label__no Do you have a feature idea? Make a feature request.
__label__dc The Python code is auto-formatted using Black whichis configured as a pre-commit hook. There are also numerous editor integrations.
__label__dc - We (sort of) follow these Ruby style guidelines
__label__sc - Have unit tests, functional tests, and fuzz tests, where appropriate;
__label__dc - This is OK too:
__label__no - Running CLI integration tests
__label__sc You might be asked to make changes to your pull request. There's never a need to open another pull request. Push more commits to your existing branch. We'll squash them when we merge the PR.
__label__no The documentation is automatically generated from the TypeScript annotations in the components. You can add comments above the type annotations to add descriptions. To preview the generated documentation, run yarn docs start in the project root.

__label__no - There must be at least one person willing and committed to maintain it.They may but do not have to be the people who wrote the code. Similarly,they may but do not have to be affiliated with the hardware manufacturer.In the first instance, code maintenance would mean keeping the port up tospeed by submitting pull requests as Contiki moves forward. In the longerterm, people who maintain a reasonable level of commitment and who demonstratethat they know what they're doing may be invited to become repo collaborators.
__label__cf Commit changes made in response to review comments to the same branch on yourfork.
__label__no - If it ultimately can't be verified, close until we have enough information to verify (e.g., in most cases we need a full set of Appium logs to help diagnose an issue).
__label__no Cosmetic bugs are still bugs, impossible ideas might be possible.
__label__cf Please do not do any work that you plan to submit as a pull request before discussing it first. Before you do any significant work you should first open an issue indicating what you specifically are interested in working on. We can then have a discussion about whether what you propose is in line with our plans and direction for the project as well as whether the timing is right for the specifc changes you have in mind or whether there may be other planned things that should be done first. Later this issue can be referenced by a pull request.
__label__sc Important: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your workunder the Apache 2.0 License.
__label__cf 1.  No --force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way.
__label__no In this case, please consider suggesting an enhancement. Feature and improvement requests help us a lot.

__label__no It's hard to define what is a trivial contribution. Sometimes even a 1 character change can be considered significant. Unfortunately because it can be subjective, the decision on what is trivial comes from the committers of the project and not from folks contributing to the project. It is generally safe to assume that you may be subject to signing the CLA and be prepared to do so. Ask in advance if you are not sure and for reasons are not able to sign the CLA.
__label__ct 5.  For bonus points, write and publish a case study to explain how you built it.

__label__sc We may have feedback for you in the form of requested changes or fixes. We generally like to see that pushed against the same topic branch (it will automatically update the PR). You can also fix/squash/rebase commits and push the same topic branch with --force (while it is generally acceptable to do this on topic branches not in the main repository, a force push should be avoided at all costs against the main repository).

__label__sc Note: Code review is a burdensome but important part of the development process, and as such, certain types of pull requests are rejected. In general, if the improvements do not warrant the review effort required, the PR has a high chance of being rejected. It is up to the PR author to convince the reviewers that the changes warrant the review effort, and if reviewers are "Concept NACK'ing" the PR, the author may need to present arguments and/or do research backing their suggested changes.

__label__sc - Step 3: Accept or refuse a pull request. The relevant maintainer does this (see below "Who decides what?")
__label__sc Please check with us via the discussion forumbefore investing significant effort in a planned Pull Request submission; it's possible that we arealready working on a related PR or have decided that the enhancement does not belong in the coreAngularJS Material project.

__label__dc Despite its power, template metaprogramming came to the language prettymuch by accident. Templates were never meant to be used for compile-timealgorithms and type transformations. This is why C++ punishes metaprogrammingwith an insane amount of syntax noise. In CAF, we make excessive use oftemplates. To keep the code readable despite all the syntax noise, we have someextra rules for formatting metaprogramming code.
__label__sc Give the PR a descriptive title and in the description field describe what you have done in general terms and why. This will help the reviewers greatly, and provide a history for the future.
__label__dc If your implementation depends on a 3rd party library, and you think it is critical, then please communicate this before you change the solution/projects references. We are striving to provide a bare-bones library of data structures and algorithms.

__label__no Reporting issues
__label__sc One thing at a time: A pull request should only contain one change. That does not mean only one commit, but one change - however many commits it took. The reason for this is that if you change X and Y but send a pull request for both at the same time, we might really want X but disagree with Y, meaning we cannot merge the request. Using the Git-Flow branching model you can create new branches for both of these features and send two requests.
__label__cf First: if you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.
__label__dc - Offsets must be placed in BW/offsets.h.
__label__no - Motivation for or Use Case - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you

__label__sc - No one-commit-to-rule-them-all Large commits that changes too many things at the same time are very hard to review. Split large commits into smaller. See this StackOverflow question for information on how to do this.
__label__no - Using GitHub Issues and Community Forums
__label__no If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, we recommend that you firstreview the latest master version of the Online Documentationand use one of the Demos to create a CodePen that reproduces the issue.

__label__sc - tick the Patch Attached button on the issueWe prefer patches has unit tests as well and that these unit tests have proper assertions as well, so remember to replace your system.out or logging with an assertion instead!
__label__sc - Fix any merge conflicts
__label__sc 2.  If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
__label__dc - Tweakable/serialised variables are private and tagged with SerializeField
__label__sc - For changes in other modules (like moment or date-fns) the scope should be module name:

__label__sc Finding dependency cycles between packages
__label__sc After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:
__label__sc The following guidelines must be followed in EVERY pull request that is opened.
__label__sc The latest changes to the CLI are in the develop branch on github. This is the default branch when you clone the git repository.
__label__no Before submitting an issue, please ensure that the issue still exists in the latest version of the library.  Because we follow semver, you can safely upgrade patch releases (x.y.z) and feature releases (x.y) without worry of breaking API changes.
__label__dc 0. Providing [BDD] (http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/) style tests should provide for the need to use scenarios to test the design of your API
__label__sc 1.  Tests: To ensure high quality code and protect against future regressions, we require all the code in Chef Projects to have at least unit test coverage. We use RSpec for unit testing.

__label__ct The date-fns functionality is comprehensive and covers most of the use cases,however it doesn't have extended time zone support. Please leave a commentto the Extended time zones support issueif you are interested in the functionality or want to help with development.
__label__no Some Caveats Up Front:
__label__cf 7.  Submit a pull request.
__label__no Committers are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go throughthe proper review process, and have other committers merge their pull requests.
__label__dc Shell
__label__sc - Latest before branching to beta the release notes are updated to reflect thecontent up to that point.
__label__bw Prerequisites
__label__no - Explain that you were able to recreate the bug. Provide the exact test code ran and the versions of Cypress, OS, and browser you used to recreate it.
__label__no For practical purpose, there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for merging pull requests.
__label__sc When sending a pull request, consider the following guidelines:
__label__no - Reporting a bug? Follow our comments in the Issue Template, which ispre-filled when you create the new GitHub Issue.
__label__bw Make sure you have a local PostgreSQL database named carrierwave_test with the username
__label__sc - Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
__label__cf Development
__label__no 3.  Project names helps in using basic heuristics in finding projects as well it's associated test projects during CI process.
__label__tc - Join one of the community calls:
__label__cf 3.  Clone your fork of the repository locally (i.e., git clone git@github.com:yourusername/aframe).
__label__sc 2.  If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
__label__sc Make sure that all tests are passing before submitting a pull request.
__label__no Open
__label__sc 1.  Make sure you have opened an issue and it was approved by a project maintainer before working on a PR
__label__no *
__label__bw The fastest way to get a database up and running is to issue the following command:
__label__sc Use succinct words to describe what did you do in the commit change.
__label__cf The following steps will get you setup to contribute changes to this repo:
__label__cf 2.  You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
__label__cf yarn test
__label__bw Updating Ruby (and handling Ruby updates)
__label__no For Maintainers
__label__cf Please note that an issue is required for all project contributions. The following is a list of the different types of contributions:
__label__sc Please review the Commit Level and Authorization Guidelines fordetails on how to implement and submit your fixes, changes, or enhancements to AngularJS Material.
__label__no - The version of our code being used
__label__sc Must be one of the following:
__label__sc - @angular-devkit/architect
__label__sc - One of the Chocolatey Team members, or one of the committers, will evaluate it within a reasonable time period (which is to say usually within 2-4 weeks). Some things get evaluated faster or fast tracked. We are human and we have active lives outside of open source so don't fret if you haven't seen any activity on your pull request within a month or two. We don't have a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for pull requests. Just know that we will evaluate your pull request.
__label__cf 1.  Describe the problem clearly in the Pull Request description.
__label__sc - Include all changed files in your commit - The generated test files are checked in along with changes to the test data files.
__label__sc 1.  Must not break the test suite (yarn test), nor reduce test coverage (yarn coverage). If you're fixing a bug, include a test that would fail without your fix.
__label__no - Feature Requests
__label__sc Once all of the above steps are met, the following process will be followed:
__label__no This document is a guide for those maintaining Cucumber-Rails, and others who would like to submit patches.
__label__no Submitting Feature Requests

__label__no Feature Requests
__label__no When posting to the list, make sure you provide as much relevant information as possible - recommendations for an issue report (see above) are a good starting point.Please make it very clear which version of Caffe you are using, especially if it is a fork not maintained by BVLC.
__label__sc - Try to maintain a single feature/bugfix per pull request. It's okay to introduce a little bit of housekeepingchanges along the way, but try to avoid conflating multiple features. Eventually all these are going to go into asingle commit, so you can use that to frame your scope.
__label__ct What You Can Contribute

__label__ct Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels ((enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
__label__no - Contributing Process
__label__no Apache Cassandra and Pull Requests
__label__sc Most code changes will require new unit tests. (Even bug fixes require unit tests,since the presence of bugs usually indicates insufficient tests.) CVXPY testslive in the directory cvxpy/tests, which contains many files, each of whichcontains many unit tests. When adding tests, try to find a file in which yourtests should belong; if you're testing a new feature, you might want to createa new test file.

__label__sc In case you'd rather have someone else run the tests, you can use travis-ci for yourown GitHub fork of CRIU. It will check the compilation for various supported platforms,as well as run most of the tests from the suite. See https://travis-ci.org/checkpoint-restore/criufor more details.
__label__sc - Must be tested in all supported platforms [*]
__label__sc Howto Test:If you want to test the Tracker just compile it with MonoDevelop. The Tracker searches (and creates if notfound) for a directory named ./torrents. In this Directory every Torrent is loaded on startup. To testthe Torrent you need some torrents pointing at the Tracker. This can be done with the unit test. Justrun gnunit2 and load the Common.dll in src/bin/Debug. Copy the single.torrent and torrentcreator.torrentinto src/bin/Debug/torrents and start the Tracker in MonoDevelop. Then you can load the Torrents in Azureusor BitTorrent and check if the Tracker reacts on Announces and Scrapes.

By default, your fork will have a remote named "origin", which points to your fork, but you can add another remote named "codeigniter", which points to git://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4.git. This is a read-only remote, but you can pull from this develop branch to update your own.

__label__sc If you are submitting a change that will affect a compiled file, such as most of the files in admin/resources/assets/sass or admin/resources/assets/js of the Bagisto repository, do not commit the compiled files. Due to their large size, they cannot realistically be reviewed by a maintainer. This could be exploited as a way to inject malicious code into Bagisto. In order to defensively prevent this, all compiled files will be generated and committed by Bagisto maintainers.

__label__dc - Make lines a reasonable length.
__label__sc How are decisions made?
__label__no Whilst we do try to look at each and every issue as soon as possible, there are certainaspects about your report that will determine how quickly/deeply we'll delve into it. A greatissue will contain at least the following:
__label__sc $ git fetch upstream$ git rebase upstream/master
__label__no There will inevitably be suggestions that will not fit within the scope of Cypress's vision for our product. If an issue or pull request falls under this category you should:

__label__sc Contributions to Botpress will be dual-licensed under AGPLv3 and the Botpress Proprietary License. This means that all contributors need to agree to the dual-license before their contributions can be accepted. This is an automatic process when creating the pull-request.
__label__no Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your ideafits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strongcase to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Pleaseprovide as much detail and context as possible. Please also see the note in theDeveloper guidelines about implementing new features as plugins.

__label__cf To send us a pull request, please:
__label__ct In general it is preferred to keep reporters that require specific dependenciesout of nerve because that way you can select the version of dependencies thatyou need (for example if you have a particular version of the docker api oretcd). That being said, if your reporter has no external dependencies(e.g. files) or is extremely common (e.g. zookeeper, etcd), we may choose tosupport it in the repo itself.

__label__no - describe the actual result
__label__sc 4.  Allow the project the Unlimited Rights to your contribution
__label__no Contributing to ReactPlayer
__label__dc - Instance methods: If the functionality requires a reference to a Cheerioinstance, informally define the method as "private" using the followingconventions:
__label__bw If you'd like to work on a pull request and you've never submitted code before, follow these steps:
__label__bw Using an IDE:
__label__sc - If it is a trivial commit or one of formatting/spaces fixes, it should be prefixed with (maint).
__label__bw - Make sure you have node & yarn installed locally
__label__no a = (uint8_t) ~P0_1; /* Cast to a typedef. Space gets added here (incorrect) */a = (int)~P0_1;      /* Cast to a known type. Space gets removed (correct) */a = (uint8_t)P0_1;   /* Variable directly after the cast. Space gets removed (correct) */
__label__sc We may have feedback for you to fix or change some things. We generally like to see that pushed against the same topic branch (it will automatically update the Pull Request). You can also fix/squash/rebase commits and push the same topic branch with --force (it's generally acceptable to do this on topic branches not in the main repository, it is generally unacceptable and should be avoided at all costs against the main repository).
__label__cf 3.  Add the official repository (upstream) as a remote repository:
__label__sc Making a pull request
__label__no - Plugins and versions (capistrano-rvm, capistrano-bundler, etc.)
__label__no This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source codeheld within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would beextremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.
__label__tc The developermailing listshould be used to discuss complicated or controversial consensus or P2P protocol changes before working ona patch set.
__label__no - If a bug is not fully fixed after its issue is closed, open a new issue instead of re-opening the existing one (unless the code has been reverted).
__label__no - W3C link checker https://validator.w3.org/checklink
__label__sc - If working in the Python implementation:
__label__no - sinon
__label__no Crowdin
__label__no - datastore
__label__bw Development
__label__bw $ DEBUG=cypress:launcher yarn test --scope @packages/launcher

__label__no *
__label__no script to ensure all folder paths exist.
__label__cf 2.  Clone your fork
__label__bw 2.  Add a setting to appsettings.json (be careful not to check it in)
__label__no - Don't cross-post: if you create an issue, and all the information is contained there, that's enough. There's no reason to also post it to Stackoverflow; it just creates "line noise". The project maintainers are very busy people like you and me, and things will sometimes take a few weeks (or in worst case, more) to answer. If you are in a rush - do your very best to investigate the problem thoroughly; if possible, fix the bug yourself and submit a pull request.
__label__sc <type>[optional scope]: <description>
__label__dc - VSCode: vscode-tslint
__label__bw If you're on your host computer and navigate to ~/assemblymade/coderwall (we're all there, right?) and make changes to your code while Vagrant is running you'll be able to see the changes reflected in Vagrant immediately. Try this.
__label__dc Coding guidelines
__label__no We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. Like for example:
__label__dc A few of our coding conventions are not yet enforced by the linter/auto-formatter. Be careful to follow these conventions in your PR's.
__label__sc git pull [--rebase] upstream master
__label__sc 1.  Pull requests are actual commits with your modified code
__label__no Submitting a Bug Report
__label__sc - Commit messages for breaking changes must include a line (in the optional body or footer)starting with "BREAKING CHANGE: " followed by an explanation of what the breaking change was.For example,
__label__cf - GitHub pull request documentation
__label__bw 2.  If tests fail on NullReferenceException in OptionsService, just rerun them (Roslyn issue, looking into it).
__label__no General information
__label__dc yarn storybook: starts storybook server and loads stories in files thatends with .stories.tsx
__label__sc git fetch upstreamgit rebase upstream/master

__label__cf If you are interested in making a large contribution to this library there is some recommended reading / training we suggest. There is a large amount of different libraries, techniques and tools used in react-beautiful-dnd and we have created a list with resources about them. Not everything in the list will be applicable to everyone. But it is a great reference and starting point for those who do not know where to start.
__label__sc Frontend Testing
__label__sc git branch -D my-fix-branch
__label__sc - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.
__label__sc This is to ensure that links do not go dead in older versions of Cypress when the location of the link has changed. To add a new link:
__label__no - state the action(s) you took
__label__dc If you are throwing an exception, it should be done via CATCH_ERRORor CATCH_RUNTIME_ERROR in catch_enforce.h. These macros will handlethe differences between compilation with or without exceptions for you.However, some platforms (IAR) also have problems with exceptions-relatedfunctions, such as std::current_exceptions. We do not have IAR in ourCI, but luckily there should not be too many reasons to use these.However, if you do, they should be kept behind aCATCH_CONFIG_DISABLE_EXCEPTIONS macro.
__label__sc - Submit your pull request.
__label__sc - DO include new tests when adding new features.
__label__no 1.  This is the first step
__label__no - The proposal aligns with our current goals for the upcoming release.
__label__sc Please make sure the email client you're using doesn't screw your patch (line wrapping and so on).
__label__no - DynamoDB (local)
__label__no 3.  Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced testcase and a live example.
__label__no - Orientation
__label__bw Before you begin contributing, you should install the integration-tools globally on your machine:
__label__no Please start a discussion on the core repo issue tracker.
__label__sc Title and Description for the Pull Request
__label__sc 3.  Update version number in lib/authlogic/version.rb
__label__no - Clone the ABP repository from GitHub.
__label__sc Contributing
__label__no The goal is to make the common use-cases exposed via simple controls on UI while allowing further customizations to be done through hooks and scripts. If a new feature is doable via the existing features, or a basic tool, do not add it to CapRover. We do not want to bloat this application. One example is: "Add a flag to customize the placement constraints of containers". This is definitely doable in Docker, but we don't want to mirror every single functionality of Docker to CapRover. If we do that, CapRover becomes a very hard to maintain project. Instead we should add customization hooks for these advanced and rare use cases. For example, instead of mirroring every single nginx config, we added the ability of customizing the nginx config for advanced users.- Last but not least AVOID LARGE PULL REQUESTS at all cost as they won't get reviewed unless they are discussed in the Slack channel beforehand.
__label__sc - use slashes to seperate parts of branch names
__label__sc - Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts,we can't really merge your change).
__label__no - master ?? Pull Request ????????
__label__no Extending with new API. Whenever you want to introduce a new API, please send an email to the mailing list along with the link to the issue. Consider good API name for the object or function, read the API Design Principle article. It may require few iterations to agree on the final API and hence it is important to engage all interested parties as early as possible.
__label__dc This means:
__label__tc Community Forums
__label__cf - Clone the aelf repository from Github.
__label__sc - Make the required updates.
__label__no When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't alreadyreported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:
__label__sc - If you plan to do a change that touches many files (10+), please ask beforehand. This usually causes merge conflicts for other developers.
__label__sc Push to the branch
__label__dc Linting and tests
__label__no Simple, standard data objects: Sending & receiving data to AWS Services can have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys, etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow focus on state and data types only.
__label__no - Bug Reports
__label__sc Tests
__label__sc See here for aquick way to get a testing chef server up.
__label__bw Tools
__label__sc - test: adding or updating tests, eg add integration tests using detox.
__label__no Being an open source contributor doesn't just mean writing code, either. You canhelp out by writing documentation, tests, or even giving feedback about theproject (and yes - that includes giving feedback about the contributionprocess). Some of these contributions may be the most valuable to the project asa whole, because you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, so you can seethe errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
__label__no - Setting Up the project locally
__label__cf Information about contributing to Audacity is available at https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Contribute
__label__no 2.  This is the second step
__label__sc - IMPORTANT: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
__label__no Other
__label__no - Licenses that are compatible with the Apache license:
__label__no 1.  Review the GitHub Pull Request Backlog.  Code reviews are open to all.
__label__no - Please provide any additional information below.
__label__cf - Snippets should solve real-world problems, no matter how simple and should be abstract enough to be applied to different scenarios.
__label__no :+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:
__label__cf 1.  Fork the repo:
__label__dc 3.  Please add documentation to any new functions, methods, actions and filters.
__label__dc Code style
__label__dc You can also do that per package:
__label__sc 2.  git clone it and composer install the dependencies
__label__no If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.
__label__dc - Run make (with no parameters) to run style checks, and to generate and run tests on both implementations.
__label__no - Use :+1: :-1: emojis instead of replying 'me too' or 'I also have this.'
__label__sc - For individuals we have a simple click-through form.
__label__sc - Wrap the body at 72 characters
__label__sc - Create a folder in the Bash-Snippets root directory named after the tool
__label__no Guidelines for bug reports:
__label__cf If you would like to become an active contributor to this project (or any other open source Microsoft project), please see the list of resources found on this page.
__label__no - questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question/answer might help someone else
__label__sc If you found a bug and made a patch for it:
__label__cf You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHubRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue witha proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.Please consider what kind of change it is:
__label__no Description
__label__no Contributor
__label__sc Submitting pull requests
__label__cf Work your magic. Here are some guidelines:
__label__no * Your Abp package version.
__label__sc - Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
__label__dc - Python: Just likeChromium's, our Pythoncode mostly follows PEP-8, theexceptions being the amount of space used for indentation (2 instead of 4)and the use of MixedCase functions and methods instead oflower_case_ones.
__label__no docs(changelog): update change log to beta.5
__label__sc - CI: Reviewers will not review the code until all CI tests are passed. Sometimes there can be flaky tests. You can close and open PR to re-run CI test. Please report if the issue persists. After the CI fix has been deployed to master, please rebase your PR.
__label__cf Step 1
__label__no - Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
__label__no - The expected outcome
__label__bw Contribution Prerequisites
__label__cf - We aim for simplicity. Too many options, buttons, panels etc. detract from that.
__label__dc - Try to keep your code simple and readable.
__label__bw - Visual Studio Community 2015 (free) (other editions, like Professional and Enterprise, should work too)NOTE: Visual Studio 2015 doesn't install C++ by default. You have to rerun thesetup, select "Modify" and then check Visual C++ -> Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015 (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/31955339)
__label__no Pull Request? ???? ??

__label__sc Step 6: Merge
__label__no Suggesting improvements
__label__no - babel-parser
__label__cf Welcome your pull requests for documentation and code. ?
__label__sc - Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows ourcommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventionsis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
__label__no - Stack
__label__cf This is a mature project, so it rarely takes on new features. Wemostly focus on stability, bug fixing, clarity, and performance,in that order.
__label__dc - Succinctly Commented: Too much commenting is noise (we can read code), but too little and a future maintainer might not understand why the code was written in the first place.
__label__no - Reporting a bug

__label__cf Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.
__label__bw git clone https://github.com/your-account/canvas.git
__label__cf We use the develop branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is a unstable branch.
__label__no There are many other scripts in package.json, but these are the two you're most likely to run.
__label__sc Algorithm B is faster than A because it uses binary search. The runtime is reduced from O(N) to O(log(N)).
__label__sc The patch must be complete. And by that, we mean:
__label__cf - Changes should always respect the coding style of the project
__label__dc Try to keep lines of code around 100 characters in length or less, though this is not a hard limit.If you're a few characters over then don't worry too much.
__label__no - Use the [question] or [suggestion] tags in the title.
__label__sc - Ensure that all tests pass
__label__sc - perf: A code change that improves performance
__label__no We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.
__label__bw Note: Make sure to always sync your fork with main branch of amplify-js

__label__no Releases & Versioning
__label__sc Now active work is supposed to be done. Therefore a new branch should be created. Let's create one:
__label__no Ground rules
__label__cf Want a Feature?
__label__no We are a fully distributed company with team members spread across Earth. All positions are Remote.
__label__bw - Install Node.js
__label__sc If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit <hash>., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
__label__sc - Once the pull request is in, please do not delete the branch or close the pull request (unless something is wrong with it).
__label__cf Any changes to the code base should follow the style and coding conventionsused in the rest of the project. The version history should be clean, andcommit messages should be descriptive and properlyformatted.
__label__ct Get started
__label__sc 4.  Please avoid making opinion-based changes if it's just a code-style change - this includes, but not limited to, changes to how we work with promises, class inheritence and etc.
__label__sc master is for the current release. It has already been distributed to jcenter and can't be modified at this point (except for docs that may be incorrect for the current release!).

__label__no Compatibility
__label__no 3.  Code snippet from your model of the validations
__label__no For now, non-compiling examples will not yet block the build, but at some pointin the future they will.

__label__no - What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
__label__cf Contributing via Pull Requests
__label__sc git remote add upstream https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client.gitgit fetch upstreamgit branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
__label__ct If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at theissues with the "contributions welcome"label.These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outsidecontributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If youdecide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know thatyou're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issuecomment thread to coordinate.
__label__no If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.
__label__sc 4.  Just run npm publish and sit back.
__label__sc 2.  Clone your forked repo to your local machine
__label__sc Run all tests:
__label__sc It is enough to provide us such notification once.
__label__sc - Make sure you explicitly say to not complete the pull request if you are still making changes.
__label__sc - ci(@angular/cli): fix publishing workflow
__label__no Contributing
__label__sc - steps to test the fix (if applicable)
__label__sc - Build angular-gantt.
__label__dc Ruby versions
__label__sc This ensures that your history is "clean" i.e. you have one branch off from dev followed by your changes in a straight line. Failing to do this ends up with several "messy" merges in your history, which we don't want. This is the reason why you should always work in a branch and you should never be working in, or sending pull requests from dev.
__label__no Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reportsand feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on dedicatedsupport platforms, the best being Stack Overflow.
__label__no Writing code
__label__sc - For a new feature, write a test by adding of modifying test files located in test/**.
__label__cf Contributing
__label__no - Make a commit within git
__label__no 2.  Issues list
__label__no Quick Iteration
__label__no - Next, create a new issue that thoroughly explains the problem. Please fill out the populated issue form before submitting the issue.

__label__sc Contributions are welcome, and are accepted via pull requests. Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests.
__label__no - Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
__label__no There are two versions of the agreement:
__label__no 6.  Describe your Issue as thoroughly as possible and add logs so that we can reproduce it.
__label__cf - Does my feature belong to a framework library?
__label__no GitHub issues should always be logged in the Cucumber monorepo.
__label__sc If you're working on a long running feature then you may want to do this quite often, rather than run the risk of potential merge issues further down the line.
__label__sc - Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
__label__bw Get the source code
__label__no - Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)
__label__no Anyone who is a core contributor (see the Core Contributors Heading in the Readme) can publish a release:

__label__no This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source code held within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would be extremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.
__label__no 3.  Follow your issue in the issue tracking workflow
__label__ct - good first issue: Good for newcomers, new comer can pickup one for warm-up.
__label__no We do this for a couple of reasons:

__label__no - Atom FAQ
__label__no - Code of Conduct
__label__no Via theAbseil Compatibility Guidelines, wehave promised a large degree of API stability. In particular, we will not makebackward-incompatible changes to released APIs without also shipping a tool orprocess that can upgrade our users' code. We are not yet at the point of easilyreleasing such tools. Therefore, at this time, shipping a library establishes anAPI contract which is borderline unchangeable. (We can add new functionality,but we cannot easily change existing behavior.) This constraint forces us tovery carefully review all APIs that we ship.
__label__bw The following table describes the most important build targets:
__label__no - Rules
__label__sc Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various Git tools.
__label__no - If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
__label__bw Clone the repo:
__label__cf - Once you get a nod from one of the Chocolatey Team, you can start on the feature.
__label__dc gem fetch -v OLD_VERSION GEM_NAMEgem unpack GEMNAME-OLD_VERSION.gem
__label__dc const std::string& name() const {return name_}
__label__sc Must be one of the following:
__label__no - Respecting
__label__no Before submitting a bug report:
__label__no If someone submits a pull request that is not perfect, and you are reviewing, it is better to think about the PR's motivation rather than the specific implementation. Having braces on the wrong line should not be a blocker. Though we do want to keep test coverage high, we will work with you to figure that out together.
__label__sc - Give it a meaningful name instead of, e.g. prevent-zero-divide instead of just fix
__label__dc Line length
__label__dc - Format constructor initializer lists as follows (so that the colon is in the same column as the commas):

__label__no Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page.
__label__cf If you're a developer, please take a look at the Developer guidelines
__label__no - Localization
__label__no - Contributing
__label__sc - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
__label__no For example, the image referenced above actually lives in superset-frontend/images/tutorial. Since the image is moved during the documentation build process, the docs reference the image in _static/images/tutorial instead.
__label__no - Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.
__label__dc - Exception: Do not quote variables that contain regular expression patternsappearing on the right side of the =~ operator.
__label__dc - Leave a single space after a comma (,) character (both in the description and code).
__label__no However as Botpress has a great module system consider whether the feature you're requesting would be better as a module, rather than expanding the core platform.
__label__no The following is where you can find out how to get set up to run locally as well as detailed information on exactly how Imgbot works.
__label__no - Pull requests ?
__label__no Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue beingreported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified ascausing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on theirmerits).
__label__sc We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to morereadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,we use the git commit messages to generate the UI Kitten change log.
__label__cf - Fix Bugs
__label__dc How this library performs dragging is an implementation detail. The api is what users interact with. That said, this library does not use the html5 drag and drop api. The main reason is that html5 drag and drop does not allow the level of control we need to create our powerful and beautiful experiences. I could go into detail but this is not the right forum.
__label__cf Doris's code and documentation
__label__no The following information is here to walk you through your first and future contributions. Following these guidelines also helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

__label__sc - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
__label__sc $ BABEL_ENV=cov make build$ ./scripts/test-cov.sh
__label__no - Specify which version of AdAway you're using.You can get the exact version by opening in-app help and checking the last About tab.
__label__cf The process for contributions is roughly as follows:
__label__sc The easiest way to submit a patch is to
__label__no bugfix/what-it-is-fixing
__label__dc - linktypes.py: enum for the three types of linking (none, symlink, children)
__label__sc 1.  Where appropriate (all python code) unit tests are required. JS unit tests are encouraged but at the moment are not well instrumented.
__label__sc - Capitalize the subject line
__label__no What you should keep in mind
__label__no - The port must be accompanied by examples demonstrating basic functionality. This couldbe a set of examples under examples/<new-hardware-port> and/or documentation ofwhich existing examples are meant to work.
__label__sc Some helpful things to consider before submitting your work
__label__no - Review the feature/fixes
__label__bw Start your app using Heroku Local
__label__dc Spacing and Line Breaks
__label__no I don't want to read this whole thing, I just have a question!!!
__label__no - For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can bediscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
__label__no 3.  Steps to reproduce:
__label__cf 1.  Fork the project repository. Click on the
__label__dc - Use @ for doxygen commands.
__label__bw In many cases, you don't really need to build the entire project. Say you want to work on the @aws-cdk/aws-ec2 module:
__label__cf - Keep feature branches as small as possible, preferably one new featureper branch.
__label__sc $ yarn build # Build the whole library$ yarn link-all # Make all the packages available to link$ yarn build:esm:watch # All packages are building ES6 modules in watch mode
__label__bw Building / multiplatform
__label__no Consider asking your company to also support this open source project bybecoming a sponsor.
__label__sc - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
__label__no Example:
__label__cf - Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
__label__dc - UI themes are named [theme-name]-ui
__label__no 4.  Install the latest version of AutoRest and use it to generate your C# client. For more info on getting started with AutoRest, see the AutoRest repository
__label__no If you're not using the latest version, please consider alsotesting with the latest. There's a good chance the bug you foundhas already been fixed.
__label__no Onion is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from ourcommunityblog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and featurerequests or writing code which can be incorporated into onion.

__label__no Overview
__label__sc Step 4: Run the tests
__label__no - Discussing the current state of the code
__label__ct Contributing features, refactors, and performance improvements to the "core" ofSucrase (the parser and the transformers) may need some more thought and care.See the Project Vision for some thoughts on whattypes of improvements make sense for the project, and make sure to start adiscussion before getting too deep in the code. Some problems may be best solvedoutside of the core Sucrase code, or may be better as a fork of Sucrase.
__label__no 2.  Having to constantly query users to gather information is very frustrating! Use the bug template provided above.
__label__sc - Each pull request should address a single bug fix or enhancement. This may consist of multiple commits. If you have multiple, unrelated fixes or enhancements to contribute, submit them as separate pull requests.
__label__sc git push origin [--force] feature-xxx
__label__no - Asking for more detail in an issue when it is needed is helpful.

__label__no - For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can bediscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
__label__sc - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missingsemi-colons, etc)
__label__no Creating a feature request
__label__no - Run the template to generate the project.
__label__no e.g.
__label__sc $ sudo -u postgres createuser you_username --createdb --superuser$ npm run clean:server:test
__label__sc For example in case @angular-devkit/core package was modified you need to run:

__label__no AzuraCast is used around the world, and we want our web application to be accessible to users who aren't familiar with English, our primary language.
__label__sc All unittests are available in tests directoryand use python unittest.
__label__dc - Use one level of indentation per "open" template and place the closing >,>::type or >::value on its own line. For example:
__label__sc <type>(<scope>): <subject><BLANK LINE><body><BLANK LINE><footer>
__label__no This is a different way to handle open source! Where did it come from?
__label__sc - Check out the master branch:
__label__no - Overview of the Issue - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
__label__sc - Give a brief explanation about the problem that may currently exist and how your requested feature solves this problem.
__label__sc You must sign your work, certifying that you either wrote the work or otherwise have the right to pass it on to an open source project. git makes this trivial as you merely have to use --signoff on your commits to your CodeIgniter fork.

__label__sc A pull request is generally reviewed according to the following rules:
__label__no - Step 1: Determine the subdirectory affected by the pull request. This might be src/registry, docs/source/api, or any other part of the repo.
__label__cf We ask that before significant effort is put into code changes, that we have agreement on taking the change before time is invested in code changes.

__label__sc Testing
__label__no - It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.
__label__sc - Run yarn watch inside bootstrap-vue

__label__cf Pull requests
__label__no How to Debug ECharts
__label__sc If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert: , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit <hash>., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
__label__no Basic templating in staging

__label__bw The required version is VirtualBox 4.3.20.
__label__dc - Include specs to test any changes you've made
__label__cf 4.  Add tests for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, add a test!

__label__cf 4.  Build and deploy the checked out version ofcf-release. We recommend usingbosh-lite for this.
__label__sc Pull Request Guide
__label__sc - Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
__label__sc You can do some things to increase the chance that your pull request is accepted the first time:
__label__cf 1.  Grab our latest Release (or even better: compile development branch).
__label__tc - Sending patches for features or bug fixes.
__label__cf Well-constructed pull requests are very welcome. By well-constructed, we meanthey do not introduce unrelated changes or break backwards compatibility. Justfork this repo and open a request against develop.
__label__sc To this:
__label__cf Try and avoid making breaking changes. Those take more time to ship. Instead make the new behavior opt-in. This way your feature can ship, and you can use it, on its own schedule.
__label__cf - For anything but very small or quick changes, you should always start bychecking the Issues page to see if the work is already being doneby another person.
__label__tc Drop into our gitter chat room and let us know what you're thinking of doing. We might be able to give you guidance or let you know if someone else is already working on the feature.
__label__no - Testing (and any backtraces if you happpen to crash darktable)
__label__sc - Create a new branch for your modifications. This branch should be based on the latest contiki master branch.
__label__cf 5.  Open a pull request, and select develop as the base branch. Never open a pull request to release/xxx branches.
__label__sc - As part of the pull request (aka, in the text box on GitHub as part of submitting the pull request):
__label__sc Commit messages should be verbose by default consisting of a short subject line(50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separateparagraph(s), unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typoin init.cpp") in which case a single title line is sufficient. Commit messages should behelpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning foryour decisions. Further explanation here.
__label__sc - Must adhere to conventionalcommits.
__label__dc - Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
__label__sc - that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms.
__label__bw $ mvn clean package -DskipTests$ ./bin/ksql-server-start -daemon config/ksql-server.properties$ ./bin/ksql
__label__dc Please see the Cmdlet Best Practices document for information about cmdlet design guidelines.
__label__dc - dependency-lint
__label__no 5.  Bridge.NET Blog
__label__cf - To help keep the project running smoothly
__label__dc - Use braces for indenting if statements and loops. Avoid single-line if statements and loops, especially nested ones.
__label__cf 2.  You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
__label__sc How we handle proposals
__label__no - Explain the Conan version, Operating System, compiler and any other tool that could be related to the issue.
__label__no 9.  Include a screencast if relevant - Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? The most helpful thing in the world is if we can see what you're talking about. Use LICEcap to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your GitHub issue.
__label__sc Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any codechanges to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!
__label__sc - Create a new feature branch. It's important that you do your work on your own branch and that it's created off of dev. Tip: Give it a descriptive name and include the issue number, e.g. implement-lengthframeencoder-323 or 295-implement-recvbuffer, so that others can see what is being worked on.
__label__no Whenever you invoke the "obvious fix" rule, please say so in your commit message:
__label__no Fill out our Issue Template
__label__no That's it! The more information you give, the more easy it becomes for us to track it down and fix it. Ideal scenario would be adding the issue to CanCanCan test suite or to a sample application.
__label__no enum COMMENT_STATUS {NONEAPPROVEDREJECTEDPREMODSYSTEM_WITHHELD}
__label__sc Running linting/tests
__label__dc - Inline exports with expressions whenever possible// Use this:export default class ClassName {
__label__sc The commit message needs to link to the issue. This cross-reference is very important for the following reasons.
__label__sc After reviewing a Pull request, we might ask you to fix some commits. After you've done that you need to force push to update your branch in your local fork.
__label__sc 3.  Rebase before creating a PR to keep commit history clear.
__label__sc 2.  Create a separate branch for your changes

__label__bw Getting Started with docker
__label__cf We have some simple processes to assist in getting new features from the concept stage,right though to a released and maintained Bolt.
__label__sc The purpose is to separate problem from possible solutions.
__label__sc Please, don't forget to update your fork. While you made your changes, the content of the master branch can change because other pull requests were merged and it can create conflicts. This is why you have to rebase on master every time before pushing your changes and check that your branch doesn't have any conflicts with master.

__label__sc - patch attached to bugzilla.
__label__no Sometimes we request more information to be provided (label stage: needs information) for an open issue, but no one is able to provide a reproducible example or they simply never respond. This does not mean that we don't believe that there is a bug! We just, unfortunately, do not have a path forward to fix it without this information. In this case you should:

__label__sc - We will check your commit message, if it does not conform to the specification, the commit will be automatically refused, make sure you have read the specification above.
__label__sc 1.  Please create one pull request for each feature. This results in smaller pull requests that are easier to review and validate.
__label__cf The Tracker is a piece of Software which listens for HttpRequests. Each Request can either be an Announceor Scrape request. Therefore the Tracker needs code which handles HttpRequests. The Tracker was programmedin such a way that it is independent of the http handling code. The http handling code is called Frontend.There are currently two Frontends implemented. The first uses the class HttpListener. This implementationgot most attention. The second one uses the Asp.Net infrastructe and the HttpHandles classes. It thereforecould be used in xsp2, mod_mono or even in IIS. But the second implementation was just a proof of conceptand is not tested but should be functional. There exists and Frontend directory which contains all theFrontend handling code.
__label__no - Read through every line of changed code (Yes, we know this could be a LOT).
__label__no 1.  Make a copy of /sdk/template/Azure.Template in you appropriate service directory and rename projects to Azure.Management.* for management libraries or Azure.* (e.g.  sdk/storage/Azure.Management.Storage or sdk/storage/Azure.Storage.Blobs)

__label__no Types of Issue Labels
__label__no A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for moreinformation. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What isyour environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OSexperience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? Whatwould you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fixany potential bugs.

__label__no You have found a bug or you have an idea for a cool new enhancement? Contributing code is a great way to give something back to the open source community. Before you dig right into the code there are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.
__label__sc - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,it will not be prioritized until after the release. Wait for the release.

__label__no - Read through the entire changelog of the dependency's changes. If a changelog is not available, check every commit made to the dependency. NOTE - do not rely on semver to indicate breaking changes - every product does not follow this standard.
__label__sc - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
__label__no - Mention very precisely what went wrong. "X is broken" is not a good bugreport. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe theexact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can notfix something that we can not observe.
__label__no Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

__label__no Last, you must understand that Carbon extends PHP natives classes, that means Carbon can be impacted by any changethat occurs in the date/time API of PHP. We watch new PHP versions and handle those changes as quickly as possiblewhen detected, but as PHP does not follow the semantic versioning pattern, it basically means any releases (includingpatches) can have unexpected consequences on Carbon methods results.

__label__sc Code reviews
__label__no Hey, thank you for contributing. Here are some tips to make it easy for you.
__label__dc Code inspections, styles and abbreviation rules.
__label__no - If you find a solution to your problem update your issue report with an explanation of how you were able to fix it and close the issue.
__label__no When reporting issues, please try to be as descriptive as possible, and includeas much relevant information as you can. A step by step guide on how toreproduce the issue will greatly increase the chances of your issue beingresolved in a timely manner.
__label__no - Create a commit and raise a Pull Request
__label__sc - fix: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will addtionally reference an issueif present)
__label__sc Info: The above command will autogenerate some Java classes. The Ballerina AST builder is written on top of the auto-generated BallerinaParserBaseListener.java class. Thus, if any new rules are added to the BallerinaParser.g4, the above command will generate new methods in the BallerinaParserBaseListener.java and you need to override those newly-added methods inside the BLangParserListener.java accordingly.
__label__no To release new versions
__label__sc Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
__label__no We use a dummy project called ApiCompat to enforce API compatibility between the GA'ed libraries and the most recent version available on Nuget. This project includes package references to the GA'ed library and to Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.Each library needs to provide a ApiCompatVersion property which is set to the last GA'ed version of the library which is used to compare APIs with the current to ensure no breakshave been introduced.The ApiCompatVerification target defined in ApiCompat.csproj is referenced in the eng/Directory.Build.Data.targets which causes this target to be executed for each csproj that has the ApiCompatVersion property set. For libraries that wish to disable the APICompat check they can remove the ApiCompatVersion property from their project. Our version bump automation will automatically add or increment the ApiCompatVersion property to the project when it detects that the version it is changing was a GA version which usually indicates that we just shipped that GA version and so it should be the new baseline for api checks.
__label__sc Expenses
__label__no Start the debug build for the backend service as explained above. To see any changes you make,first save the changes, then you need to restart the service either by sending a request to /force-exit endpoint,or by running npm run dev.

__label__no Acknowledgement
__label__no Mbed TLS maintains several LTS (Long Term Support) branches, which are maintained continuously for a given period. The LTS branches are provided to allow users of the library to have a maintained, stable version of the library which contains only security fixes and fixes for other defects, without encountering additional features or API extensions which may introduce issues or change the code size or RAM usage, which can be significant considerations on some platforms. To allow users to take advantage of the LTS branches, these branches maintain backwards compatibility for both the public API and ABI.

__label__dc Code Conventions
__label__no As a developer, you must understand every change is a breaking change. What is a bug for someoneis expected in someone else's workflow. The consequence of a change strongly depends on the usage.Semantic Versioning relies to public API. In PHP, the public API of a class is its publicmethods. However, if you extend a class, you can access protected methods, then if you use reflexion, you canaccess private methods. So anything can become a public API if you force it to be. That doesn't mean we should handleany possible usage, else we would have to publish a major release for each change and it would no longer make sense.

__label__sc Make sure you follow conventional commits commit message structure. You can automatically generate conventional commit message by running yarn commit in the root of the amplify mono repo. This will run through series of question shown below
__label__cf - For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can bediscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
__label__no Here is a great example of a well defined issue: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5069.
__label__no - Testing
__label__no This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaceswhen an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples ofrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mailaddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointedrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may befurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.
__label__no Compatibility checks always run as part of a full build (yarn build).
__label__cf When you're ready to get feedback on your work, open a draft pull request. It's fine if the work's not yet done, but please do let us know what's remaining. This lets reviewers know not to nit-pick small details or point out improvements you already know you need to make.

__label__no - Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
__label__cf We're planning on cleaning everything up once 1.0 is released, so if you're able to follow these guidelines, it will make things much easier for us.
__label__sc 4.  GitHub now allows auto-squashing of commits in a PR, so no need to rebase your commits before final submission. All commit messages must follow conventional commit (angular).

__label__sc Branches
__label__sc - style - puppeteer code style: spaces/alignment/wrapping etc.
__label__bw - install the dependencies.
__label__dc } // namespace
__label__cf We ask that more significant improvements to the project be first proposed before anybody starts to code as an issue or as a draft Pull Request, which is a nice new feature that gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on the design, and maybe discuss if related work is already under way.

__label__no Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
__label__sc While you're working away in your branch it's quite possible that your upstream dev may be updated. If this happens you should:
__label__cf 1.  State clearly if it is a feature, a problem or refactoring. You can even use oneof the GitHub labels we carefully createdjust for that purpose. That makes our life easier as we tend to focus on resolvingissues quicker than adding new features
__label__sc 4.  Commit. Do not touch any unrelated code, such as the gemspec or version.If you must change unrelated code, do it in a commit by itself, so that itcan be ignored.
__label__tc Code of Conduct
__label__no It's hard to define what is a trivial contribution. Sometimes even a 1 character change can be considered significant.Unfortunately because it can be subjective, the decision on what is trivial comes from the maintainers of the projectand not from folks contributing to the project.
__label__dc Lint the project with:
__label__sc Things you should know:

__label__dc Then additional variables (import_variables and import_configs) arethen merged and take precedence over local variables.
__label__sc After a rebase, reviewers are encouraged to sign off on the force push. This should be relatively straightforward withthe git range-diff tool explained in the productivitynotes. To avoid needless review churn, maintainers willgenerally merge pull requests that received the most review attention first.

__label__cf 3.  Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
__label__sc Pull requests should generally be opened against master.
__label__sc Please be receptive and responsive to feedback about your additions or changes. The core team and/or other community members may make suggestions or ask questions about your change. This is part of the review process, and helps everyone to understand what is happening, why it is happening, and potentially optimizes your code.
__label__ct Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

__label__sc - If a PR fixes an issue, mention it in the PR description, but not in the commits themselves. Typically, we add the line Fixes #007 to the bottom of the PR description, this makes Github link the PR to the issue, auto-close the issue when the PR is merged, and also is included in the merge message.
__label__no Do your homework before asking a question
__label__no Please search existing issues first to make sure this is not a duplicate.Every issue report has a cost for the developers required to field it; berespectful of others' time and ensure your report isn't spurious prior tosubmission. Please adhere to sound bug reporting principles.

__label__no Contribution Guide
__label__sc Don't let this be a blocker for you, I'm not saying you have to do TDD. I don'tcare whether you actually write the test first, or the code first, I just careabout the order of the commits. Those with experience in reviewing PRs will knowwhy. I can grab your PR, roll it back to HEAD^ and run the test, seeing itfail and confirming that your test works, then roll it back to the head of yourbranch and see your code fixing the test. It makes it very easy to review a PR.
__label__no - Please use the following template.
__label__no You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHubRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue witha proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.Please consider what kind of change it is:

__label__no If you think your model should be part of AllenNLP Models, please create a pull request in the models repo that includes:
__label__dc - fix any deprecated entries (link_by_default, etc)
__label__bw You can download the code, compile and install it, deploy and run it for a try (refer to the [compilation document] (./installing/compilation.md)) to see if it works as you expected.

__label__dc - The code requires kqueue or epoll services from the OS, which means Linux / BSD / macOS.
__label__sc Conventions
__label__bw - nodejs - v10.x (with npm)
__label__sc - Update your master with the latest upstream version:
__label__sc 4.  The pull request should be closest to the latest target branch (a pull request of a feature from version 1.0 would most likely be unusable for a feature on version 3.0, although you might be able to use git rebase to fix that
__label__no If you work for an organization that does not allow you to contribute without attempting to own the rights to your work, please do not sign the CLA.
__label__dc See the dedicated documentation: https://docs.joinpeertube.org/#/contribute-plugins
__label__bw Since this is probably the first time you're running this command it's going to take a VERY long time (bandwidth willing) to run. This is because Vagrant needs to fetch the Coderwall base box from the Internet and it's about 1.4GB.  Fortunately that really only has to be done once (unless the base box get's updated but that's another story).
__label__no Thanks for reporting bugs, we'd be lost without you.

__label__sc Code review comments may be added to your pull request. Discuss, thenmake the suggested modifications and push additional commits to yourfeature branch. Be sure to post a comment after pushing. The new commitswill show up in the pull request automatically, but the reviewers willnot be notified unless you comment.
__label__no - Don't be afraid to introduce new pages. The current documentationtends towards long pages, but a lot of that is caused by legacy, andwe know that some of the pages are overly big and unfocused.
__label__no - Explain your purpose clearly in tags(see Useful Tags), title, or content.
__label__sc Committing Code

__label__bw 3.  Register EPEL and SCL repositories for your distro.
__label__no - have a descriptive docstring, which will eventually be extracted for thedocumentation website.
__label__sc - Please do not change the Rakefile, version, or history.(if you want to have your own version, that is fine butbump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we merge your change)
__label__no You can help with code review, which reduces bugs, and over time has awonderful side effect of making the code more readable and therefore moreapproachable. It's also a great way to teach and learn. Feel free to jump in!Be welcoming, appreciative, and helpful. You can perform first reviews ofsimple changes, like badge additions. These are usually tagged withservice badge.

__label__no Translations are also welcome.Moreover, they do not require a development environment, only a web browser.So if you want to complete or edit your language support for the application, check the translation guide.
__label__cf For instructions on this, start with thecontribution overview.
__label__cf git checkout -b "linux-bootstrap-1-fix"
__label__sc description
__label__sc The title should be brief but comprehensive, the description contains a link to the opened issue and the proposed solution. The pull request should contain tests whenever possible. Keep in mind that the bigger is the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
__label__no Before you submit an issue,search the issues archive;maybe the issue has already been submitted or considered. If the issue appears to be a bug,and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
__label__dc - The HTML5 drag and drop disaster
__label__bw yarn
__label__ct Bug fixes are much more likely to be accepted in a short term than entirely new features that might compromise other parts of Bridge.NET or developer experience.
__label__cf Step 3: Work your Magic
__label__no Reverting changes that are causing issues in the master branch is a normal and expected part of the development process. In an open source community, the ramifications of a change cannot always be fully understood. With that in mind, here are some considerations to keep in mind when considering a revert:
__label__cf 3.  ? Make your change
__label__no Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.
__label__sc - use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
__label__dc Code Style
__label__dc This is a React project so getting familiar with React is a must!
__label__sc Now you're ready to send the pull request. Go to your Cherow fork and then follow the GitHub documentation on how to send a pull request.
__label__no Please follow this simple checklist before submitting:
__label__sc - Now every time you change a component, a new production version will be built and ready on yourproject
__label__no For other issues: encourage friendly discussion, moderate debate, offer your thoughts.
__label__no Issue Template
__label__no Contributing to the IRremoteESP8266 library
__label__sc - Pull request title and description should follow the same guidelines as commit messages.
__label__no It sad but true that someone just glance(not read) Ant Design Mobile's documentation. Please read the documentation closely.
__label__sc Please make sure to refer to the Pull Request Guideline when submitting a new one.
__label__dc To make code formatting simpler for the contributors, Catch2 providesits own config for clang-format. However, because it is currentlyimpossible to replicate existing Catch2's formatting in clang-format,using it to reformat a whole file would cause massive diffs. To keepthe size of your diffs reasonable, you should only use clang-formaton the newly changed code.
__label__tc - Please do not create "this doesn't work" issues that are just one sentence long and don't provide any insight into the scope of the issue, what changes might have triggered it, or what platform you're running on. At the very minimum, please always include what host OS you're using (i.e. Ubuntu 16.04), whether you're using the Docker or Ansible installation, and whether the problem first occurred after a recent update. For visual issues, screenshots are also greatly appreciated.

__label__sc There are also some recommendations you can follow. These arenbut they will make the development more straightforward:
__label__sc Making changes to a Pull request
__label__no Feature Requests
__label__sc - refactor: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
__label__bw Go to the compodoc project and click on the "fork" button. You can then clone your own fork of the project, and start working on it.
__label__sc Our CI will automatically check that test coverage stays above a certain threshold (around 90%). To check the coverage locally in this example, you could run
__label__tc Questions
__label__sc Note: In some cases we use aliased symbols to create namespaces.
__label__no Once you have an example you would like to add there are a few guide lines to follow.Every example should:
__label__no <?php
__label__bw - cd barba
__label__sc then wait for contributors or committers to review your changes, and then for a committer to apply your patch.  This is not the preferred way to submit changes and incurs additional overhead for committers who must then create a pull request for you.
__label__sc Our continuous integration (CI) testing runs a number of checks for each pull request on GitHub Actions. You can run most of these tests locally, which is something you should do before opening a PR to help speed up the review process and make it easier for us.
__label__sc - Python code License example process.py;
__label__bw If you don't want to go to the trouble of performing the changes explained in the previous two sections you can insteaduse a config file that tells the test suite about your current database setup.
__label__cf 1.  Fork the antlr/antlr4 repo
__label__dc - In local looping scopes, single-letter variable names are generally used as follows:
__label__tc Chef is made possible by a strong community of developers and system administrators. If you have any questions or if you would like to get involved in the Chef community you can check out:
__label__sc - All tests checks pass (run ./gradlew check)
__label__dc flake8 cvxpy/
__label__no Issues & Bugfixes
__label__sc 4.  Commit to your fork using clear commit messages following the Conventional Commit Guideline.
__label__sc For example, if your changes include both bug fixes and performanceenhancements for a single driver, separate those changes into twoor more commits.  If your changes include an API update, and a newdriver which uses that new API, separate those into two commits.
__label__no - Follow the templates that autofill the editor - failure to follow the template will result in closure of the issue without resolution
__label__no - Some bugs may only occur on certain devices or versions of Android. Please add information about your device and the version of Android that is running on it (you can look these up under Settings ? About Phone), as well as which version of AntennaPod you are using.
__label__dc // example.cpp
__label__sc - perf: A code change that improves performance
__label__bw Set up the development environment
__label__sc - We do not bugfix any versions other than git master
__label__sc >build
__label__no - Command substitution
__label__sc - You should test your feature well.
__label__dc Help Us Help You
__label__no If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!
__label__cf 3.  Run the test suite. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate. Make sure you have PHPUnit 3.5+, then run phpunit from the project directory.
__label__dc 'Confluent Checks' will now be available in the CheckStyle tool window in the IDE and will auto-highlight issues in the code editor.
__label__sc 5.  Use $ yarn link @cubejs-client/core and/or $ yarn link @cubejs-client/react in your project to test changes applied.
__label__sc - If it's a bugfix branch, name it XXX-something where XXX is the numberof the issue
__label__tc 1.  Invite yourself to the A-Frame Slack channel.
__label__no - Signing the CLA
__label__no - If there are changes required, state clearly what needs to be done before the PR can be approved.
__label__sc - Is the astropy license included at the top of the file?
__label__sc If you're fixing a bug then please arrange your pull request in two commits, thefirst one will be a test that demonstrates the bug, that test will be failingwhen you create it. The second commit will be the code change that fixes thebug.
__label__sc For your proposed change, you need to have:

__label__cf 3.  Make your changes:
__label__bw Some platforms - such as IOS - forbid dynamic code generation. This prevents Just-in-Time compilation (JIT) from being used. In those cases, one can use Mono's Ahead-of-Time compilation (AOT). This results on a precompiled assembly that does not rely on JIT. There are some limitations however, most of them related to usage of generics.
__label__no * **module-name:** Yet another breaking change
__label__sc - docs: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for styled tag.

__label__cf Contribute code/features
__label__no - For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can bediscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
__label__dc - Create move constructors if appropriate.
__label__dc I recommend updating in stages (instead of all at once) since thismakes it easier to debug problems (if any).  Here is a suggested order,though these are only suggestions.In general, update one or a few related things, use rake to check it,and then commit.
__label__no If you spot a bug you are welcome to raise it on our issue page. You are also welcome to take a crack at fixing it if you like! When you create an issue you will be prompted with the details we would like you to provide.
__label__no ## x.y.z (Development)
__label__sc Note, we expect all code changes or bug-fixes to be accompanied by one or more tests added to our test suite to prove the code works. If pull requests are not accompanied by relevant tests, they will likely be closed. Since we are a team of volunteers, we don't have any more time to work on the framework than you do. Please make it as painless for your contributions to be included as possible. If you need help with getting tests running on your local machines, ask for help on the forums. We would be happy to help out.
__label__no 5.  The resulting HTML
__label__cf The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue and start a discussion.Then we can decide if and how a feature or a change could be implemented and if you should submit a pull requests with code changes.
__label__no We look forward to your contributions!
__label__cf - Is there a general use case for this feature?
__label__dc Since the PHP-FIG and their standards gain more and more followers and Anchor uses composer, which supports PSR-0 and PSR-4, all code should follow PSR-1 and PSR-2.More help on best practices for PHP development can be found on PHP the right way.

__label__ct - Code Contributions
__label__cf 1.  Fork the project on GitHub
__label__no Resolution may involve returning the issue to committers with suggestions on how tomove forward towards a consensus.

__label__sc First, install tox (listed in requirements-dev.txt) and pyenv (see their manual:pyenv installation. Make sure toactivate pyenv or start a new shell. Then, install Python versions and run tox:
__label__cf - Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
__label__sc Depending on which you're editing, you'll need to add your fork to the remotes list. By default, origin is set to upstream.For example, here's how GitHub user bsclifton would add BOTH remotes brave-browser and brave-core:
__label__no Check Stack Overflow first if you need help using Capistrano. You are more likely to get a quick response at Stack Overflow for common Capistrano topics. Make sure to tag your post with capistrano and/or capistrano3 (not forgetting any other tags which might relate: rvm, rbenv, Ubuntu, etc.)

__label__bw git clone http://github.com/<your_github_username>/cloudbox
__label__sc - Test that a new project runs correctly:
__label__bw - Now you can locally make changes to components (they are located in the components directory)Changes will be applied with webpack hot-reloading without needing to reload the page
__label__no Periodically, the library will remove deprecated functions from the library which will be a breaking change in the API, but such changes will be made only in a planned, structured way that gives sufficient notice to users of the library.
__label__sc Pull requests should be independent so they can be merged/rejected independently of otherpull requests. Every pull request must be made on a separate branch, branched off from the HEADof the master branch. No pull requests should depend on other pull requests or be branched offfrom non-master branches. Where a Pull request requires changes in multiple languages, assistancecan be sought from others (If you're not comfortable in multiple languages), who can eitherraise another pull request for the separate implementation or commit to yours (Whichever is easier).
__label__sc - Issues: Indicate issues fixed via: "Fixes #xxx" or "Closes #xxx"
__label__sc 1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from master or specific version.
__label__cf - To which Ceph versions should the feature be added?
__label__no Before you begin your contribution, please let us know in the Actionhero Slack team, which is available at https://slack.actionherojs.com. There are community members who can help you, and you may want to team up with another community member. This also helps ensure that more than one person isn't working on the same thing.
__label__sc - patch: Will increment version to next patch (default).
__label__sc - Changes made have corresponding test coverage
__label__sc - "refactor": for refactors
__label__sc 1.  From there you create a branch named specific to the feature.
__label__bw 3.  Now, step into your local clone of repository:
__label__cf Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).
__label__no Thankfully, we've adopted support for Docker, a tool that allows us to create prebuilt images with all of our software stack properly configured and arranged, which you can then run on just about any host that will run the latest version of Docker. It's portable, it's cross-platform, and pulling down new updates are far easier than before; for these reasons, we heavily emphasize using Docker over our older, Ubuntu-specific Ansible installation.
__label__no Contributing to AngularFire

__label__cf 3.  Submit a pull request.
__label__no To streamline this process, we've made this small document, to help you reportyour issue or feature more efficiently. We did our best to keep it brief, soplease read it carefully.
__label__no NOTE: When you are doing this, we almost always recommend you take the output of the build to another machine to do the testing, like the Chocolatey Test Environment.
__label__no There is an issue template for you to follow. Please provide as much information as you can according to the template.
__label__no All bugs and non-trivial changes must have an associated issue. So, step one should be making sure that your issue doesn't already exist. If you find a relevant issue, feel free to add a comment with any additional details or problems specific to your use case. Otherwise, open a new issue and fill out the template in its entirety.

__label__cf Feel free to fork and improve/enhance Ace any way you want. If you feel that the editor or the Ace community will benefit from your changes, please open a pull request. To protect the interests of the Ace contributors and users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is the simplest of agreements, requiring that the contributions you make to an ajax.org project are only those you're allowed to make. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes ten minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

__label__sc Publishing a New Release
__label__bw First, fork the repository on GitHub, then clone it. You can clone the main repository directly, but you won't be able to send pull requests.
__label__sc Before embarking on a large amount of work to implement missing functionality, please double-check with the community on the swift-corelibs-dev mailing list. Someone may already be working in this area, and we want to avoid duplication of work.
__label__no We gladly accept bugfixes, but are not actively looking to add new gateways. Please follow the guidelines here to ensure your work is accepted.
__label__no For CLA assistant service works properly, please make sure you have added email address that your commits linked to GitHub account.

__label__dc - While TODO comments are frowned upon, every now and then it is ok to put aTODO to note that a particular section of code needs to be worked on in thefuture. However, it is also known that "TODOs" often do not get worked on, andas such, it is more likely you will be asked to complete the TODO at the timeyou submit it.

__label__sc Fixing an Issue
__label__dc The configuration file (yaml) is parsed in two layers:
__label__no Please do not ask for support using the issue queue. For support, please ask on chat or the mailing list.
__label__dc You must ensure a consistent behavior on all supported version. If it is not possible, you must ensure a correct behavior.
__label__dc tox -e lint
__label__dc Linting and tests
__label__sc After you finish your code and ready to create a Pull Request, please make sure yourchange don't break build/test/lint by running bash apollo.sh check, which isequivalent to a combination of bash apollo.sh build, bash apollo.sh test andbash apollo.sh lint.
__label__dc - Running Cassandra in IDEA guide
__label__sc If you're changing the API, you'll need to ensure that the API test suite passes. If you're adding a new feature orfixing a bug, you should add corresponding tests as well.
__label__no Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.
__label__dc When breaking expressions into multiple lines, always break after an operator, such as , or &&.
__label__no - Writing Code
__label__sc 1.  From Getting Started, your work should ideally be in its own feature branch.
__label__bw 1.  In a new branch, create a new Lerna package:
__label__sc Please make sure you have test coverage for anything you add or fix!

__label__dc - To create all default staging directories: make stage
__label__sc $ npm test$ npm run lint
__label__no - Suggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might becausing the problem (line of code or commit)
__label__ct Note: this project is very conservative, so new features that aren't tagged with "please-help" might not get into core. We're trying to keep the code base small, extensible, and streamlined. Whenever possible, it's best to try and implement feature ideas as separate projects outside of the core codebase.
__label__no Bug Reports
__label__sc The following is the list of supported scopes:
__label__sc All ongoing development for an upcoming release gets committed to themaster branch. The master branch technically serves as the "development"branch as well, but all code that is committed to the master branch should beconsidered stable, even if it is part of an ongoing release cycle.
__label__cf 8.  Submit a pull-request
__label__bw We recommend to work on the code from github.
__label__sc - We will check your commit message, if it does not conform to the specification, the commit will be automatically refused, make sure you have read the specification above.
__label__cf Sometimes, the GitHub issue is sufficient for such discussions, and can be sufficient to getclarity on what you plan to do. Sometimes, a design document would work better, so people can provideiterative feedback.
__label__no Issue Contributions
__label__sc Never work directly on dev or master and you should never send a pull request from master - always from a feature branch created by you.
__label__dc - PRs are scrutinized for coding-style.
__label__sc $ npm run test:coverage
__label__sc There are two branches to be aware of, the master and the develop branch. The master branch is reserved for the latest release, so only make pull requests to the master branch for small bug- or security fixes (these are usually just a few lines). In all other cases, please make a pull request to the develop branch.
__label__cf 2.  Make your changes with tests.
__label__sc - You could use git cz with a CLI interface to replace git commit command, it will help you to build a proper commit-message, see commitizen.
__label__sc Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

__label__no - Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
__label__dc - Acronyms are words: Treat acronyms as words in names, yielding !XmlHttpRequest, getUrl(), etc.
__label__sc After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changesfrom the main (upstream) repository:

__label__sc 4.  Update your forum thread with a link to your Pull Request
__label__no *    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License

__label__sc License
__label__dc - The following syntax should be used when including header files: #include <Package/SubdirectoryChain/Header.h>This rule helps disambiguate files from different packages that have the same name. <Object.h> might appear relatively often, but <AZRender/Object.h> is far less likely to.

__label__dc The same applies to any class outside of the standard java.[n]io / java.net / java.util packages: Most of them are not supported.java.awt is one of these packages: do not use it, ever. It is not supported on any platform, even desktop - the entire package is removed during JRE minimization.In general, if you are using IntelliJ, you should be warned about platform incompatiblities.
__label__bw - Install the latest version of git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
__label__sc - Commit messages:
__label__no - Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use Slack).

__label__no Submitting an Issue
__label__sc You need to Accept the Ballerina Contributor License Agreement (CLA) when prompted by a GitHub email notification after sending your first Pull Request (PR). Subsequent PRs will not require CLA acceptance.
__label__no Then, open a pull request.
__label__no Chocolatey is a large ecosystem and each component has their own location for submitting issues and enhancement requests. While the website (the community package repository) may be all you know for packages, it represents only a tiny fraction of existing packages (organizations typically maintain and host their own packages internally). This is the repository for choco.exe (the client CLI tool) for Chocolatey, which spans multiple types of environments.
__label__no - Steps towards contributions
__label__ct - Did you create a new feature or enhancement?
__label__ct - visual design: This relates to visual elements of the site that could be improved or are broken. This may be as simple as a change to a CSS colour or font size but may stretch all the way to things that do not render as expected on mobile devices. These are usually good issues for people with front-end development experience to tackle.
__label__dc - Only quote arguments to the right of =~ if the expression is a literalmatch without any metacharacters.
__label__cf 4.  The change works in both Python2.7 and Python3.6 (support Python Versions)
__label__tc Technical issues, designs, etc. are discussed using several different channels:
__label__cf Example: https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11640
__label__no Contribution Guidelines
__label__no - Press Ctrl+PageDown to "enter" the package. You should see, among others, a [Content_Types].xml file in both panes.
__label__ct - blocked: We will generally mark an issue as blocked if it requires more context for us to fix, is waiting on an updated version of a library that the issue depends on, or is waiting on a maintainer to do something before it can be answered. There may be other conditions in which we'll mark an issue as blocked, and we'll make this clear in the issue comments.
__label__no - We introduced version tags to the documentation, which show users inwhich version a specific feature was introduced. This means that newlywritten documentation should be tagged with a placeholder, that willbe replaced with the actual version upon release. There are 2 stylesof placeholders used through the documentation, you should pick one thatfits your text better (if in doubt, take a look at the existing versiontags for other features).
__label__sc If you have more than one GitHub accounts, or multiple email addresses associated with a single GitHub account, you must sign the CLA using the primary email address of the GitHub account used to author Git commits and send pull requests.
__label__sc Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
__label__sc When changing other code, please add unit tests.
__label__bw Running a developer console
__label__dc - homepage: The Gatsby website of the homepage.
__label__no - Your operating system name and version.
__label__sc A reminder: please use separate branches for each of your PRs - it will make it easier for you to keep changes separate fromeach other and from whatever else you are doing with your repository!
__label__sc - Add accompanying test case.
__label__sc Please make sure the Allow edits from maintainers box is checked. That way we can make certain minor changes ourselves, allowing your pull request to be merged sooner.

__label__dc - Unless it is templated or performance critical code, place method implementations in the .cpp to try to keep the header more concise. The exception to this rule is simple getters
__label__dc - Snippet tags must be comma-separated, contain a primary tag as seen on the website as their first tag and an expertise tag (beginner, intermediate or advanced) as their last tag.
__label__no - Minimizes the need for packaging-related cruft files
__label__sc - New features or other non backwards compatible changes will go in the next major release branch. Development on 4.0 has not started yet, so breaking changes are unlikely to be merged in.
__label__cf When contributing code, please consider the following guidelines:
__label__dc To apply code standards you can run php-cs-fixer with following composer command:
__label__no We love features that help developers build serverless applications faster and further simplify development of serverless applications. If you have ideas for new event sources, new resource types, and new parameters within SAM, follow these steps to submit your feature request:
__label__cf Then, start hacking, doing whatever you want. Really, just play with whatyou want. After you make each "logical chunk" of changes (say, you fixed onespecific bug, or you made one specific feature), commit your changes.

__label__sc When you make a pull request, the tests will automatically be run again by Travis CI.
__label__sc 7.  Create a pull request to develop branch.
__label__dc To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:
__label__cf Rules
__label__sc - Indicate fixes #NNN or resolves #NNN with the tracking issue number.
__label__no Issues may be opened about wanting features in our Dashboard Service. In this case you should:
__label__no For security reasons, any communication referencing support tickets for Coinbaseproducts will be ignored. The request will have its content redacted and willbe locked to prevent further discussion.
__label__sc - git checkout -b <some-branch-name> <remote>/master
__label__sc - Before submitting, make sure the tests are still passing, by running npm test.
__label__no - Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
__label__sc 10. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add feature/fix bug/improve docs').If your pull request only contains documentation changes, please rememberto add [skip ci] to the beginning of your commit message so the Travistest suite doesn't :runner: needlessly.
__label__sc // options.json example{"plugins": [["@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread", { "useBuiltIns": "invalidOption" }]],"throws": "@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread currently only accepts a boolean option for useBuiltIns (defaults to false)"}
__label__no - Before opening a new issue, look for existing issues to avoid duplication. If the issue does not yet exist, create one.
__label__bw You will find the package.json file for the website in the Web/ directory of the repo. From here the input files live in the src/ directory and the generated site is output to the dist/ directory and git-ignored.
__label__cf 3.  You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.
__label__no - A sample csv
__label__sc 2.  If possible, and if applicable, please also add/update unit tests for your changes.
__label__no } // namespace cinder
__label__no - Add the type: question label to the issue.
__label__sc git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
__label__sc - changelog: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md
__label__ct - Open bugs
__label__cf Use Cassandra JIRA to create an issue, then either attach a patch or post a link to a GitHub branch with your changes.
__label__no We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal repository. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.
__label__sc 5.  Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
__label__no Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random at developer.example.org>
__label__no - ex. getWidth() const   { return mWidth; }.
__label__no Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:
__label__no - Development Setup
__label__cf 6.  Test the images in your environment.
__label__sc - {action}:
__label__dc Another complexity is that the CDK is packaged using jsii to multiple programminglanguages. This means that when a full build is complete, there will be a version of each module for each supportedlanguage.
__label__bw 1.  Fork the project, cloneyour fork:
__label__no When posting Python stack traces, please quote them usingMarkdown blocks.
__label__sc Pull requests should always be branched off the main Master branch. (There's no guarantee that what lives on the developbranch will ever make it back to master, I do a lot of experimentation).
__label__no Documentation
__label__sc The bash scripts are available in tests-ng directory.These test entire workflows by simulating the use of dotdrop from end to endfor different use-cases (usually described in their filename).
__label__no We appreciate your kind efforts in making Aurora a better software! :tada:
__label__cf 7.  Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.
__label__dc Each module also has an npm script called cfn2ts:
__label__no Improve issues
__label__sc Run npm install to install dependencies.
__label__no To run the example on web, run yarn example web in the project root.
__label__no - Full Docker build
__label__no New models
__label__ct If you're looking to contribute but aren't sure where to start, check out the open issues.
__label__dc - Identifiers (variables, functions, methods, keys, enums, etc.) should be clear and unambiguous. Make them as long as necessary to ensure that your code is understandable to others.
__label__no - Reproduce the Error - provide a live example (using StackBlitz (https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fire-start))or a unambiguous set of steps
__label__sc After these steps, you should be able to create a new Pull Request for this repository. If you hit any issues following these instructions, please open an issue and we'll see if we can improve these instructions even further.

__label__no Becoming a Committer
__label__no Contributor License Agreement
__label__no Start the discussion on the changes you propose in the Ballerina-Dev Google Group. Once there is enough consensus around the proposal, you will likely be asked to file an issue on GitHub and label it as 'Proposal' to continue a detailed discussion there.
__label__no When posting your bug, please include the following:
__label__no Needed Contributions
__label__sc 1.  Need: What function you want to achieve (Generally, please point out which issue is related).
__label__bw - Run docker container
__label__bw Homebrew
__label__no The roadmap located here
__label__no - What should I include in my issue?
__label__sc - Rewrite current tests, write new tests
__label__no - Are there clear steps to reproduce the issue? If not, let's find and document some
__label__cf - To help improve existing functionality
__label__sc - Please follow the PR checklist written below. We trust our contributors to self-check, and this helps that process!
__label__no (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and Ihave the right to submit it under the open source licenseindicated in the file; or
__label__bw Note that unzipping the Linux binary inside a Docker container onto a mapped volume drive is slow. But once this is done you can modify the application resource folder in the local folder /tmp/test-folder/node_modules/cypress/cypress-cache/3.3.0/Cypress/resources/app to debug issues.
__label__bw Building The Code
__label__no - 1)  Expose a clear roadmap for improving their component.
__label__sc Pull Request Process
__label__sc # or if you prefer using the PHP built-in web serverphp -S localhost:8000 -t public/
__label__cf Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issuesand ask for clarifications!
__label__sc Once your code is merged, it is available for free to everybody under the MIT License. Publishing your pull request on the PHPloy GitHub repository means that you agree with this license for your contribution.
__label__no - The port must provide compile regression tests by extending the existing travisintegration testing framework. Again, we can't specify explicitlywhat those tests should be, but something more interesting than hello-world is expected.
__label__no - Steps to reproduce the issue
__label__dc - To make it easier to distinguish the end of a namespace, place a comment after the namespace's closing bracket
__label__dc - When using the $BASH_IT variable, please always enclose it in double quotes to ensure that the code also works when Bash-it is installed in a directory that contains spaces in its name: for f in "${BASH_IT}/plugins/available"/*.bash ; do echo "$f" ; done
__label__sc - For corporations we'll need you toprint, sign and one of scan+email, fax or mail the form.
__label__no - General GitHub Documentation
__label__dc - actions/transformations  using variables are resolved at runtime(when action/transformation is executed) and not when loading the config
__label__no Preparation
__label__cf What should I know before I get started?
__label__sc $ make build
__label__cf 3.  Create a branch to work on your changes.
__label__no As far as testing goes, unit tests are extremely quick feedback and great for longer term maintenance, where black box tests give you the most coverage, but are the slowest feedback loops and typically the most frail. Each area of testing has strengths and weaknesses and it's good to understand each of them.
__label__dc Eslint can help to identify styling issues that may exist in your code. Your code is required to pass the test from eslint. Run the test locally by $ npm run lint.
__label__bw # Navigate to the newly cloned directorycd codesandbox-client
__label__no Provide more context by answering these questions:
__label__ct - Helping update the API, or at least just providing feedback on which API changes are affecting usability. There are several things on our radar, like integrating something like Lucene.Net.Linq directly into our project, converting the remaining public-facing iterator classes into IEnumerator<T> so they can be used with foreach loops, adding extension methods to remove the need for casting, etc.
__label__sc - Squash your commits into a single one if necessary. Each commit shouldrepresent a coherent set of changes.
__label__sc - Work in a new branch. Fork if necessary.
__label__no - Close the issue.
__label__sc At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requestswithin three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggestsome changes or improvements or alternatives.
__label__sc - Check out the master branch:
__label__sc - npm version <newversion> -m "Releasing %s"
__label__no Some other Cookiecutter templates to list in the README would be great.
__label__dc Java & Android
__label__bw Step 2: Install yarn & lerna
__label__no How to submit feature requests
