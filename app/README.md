## About
We believe that showing what our model is capable of doing is important; For this reason, we created a web application using streamlit, where users can give a repository URL, and we provide the predictions for their CONTRIBUTING.md file. 

If you are interested in our application, give it a look at: http://contributing.info/

This folder contains one of the first versions of our web application. Newer releases are being committed to: https://github.com/fronchetti/contributing.info
