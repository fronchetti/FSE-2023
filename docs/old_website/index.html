            Developers, when attempting to contribute to open source projects, often face a set of barriers that compromise the joining process.
            These barriers, in turn, may lead such developers to give up contributing to free software, directly affecting the continuity of
            projects associated with this context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the difficulties faced, there are barriers that could be overcomed through better documentation for newcomers. However, evidence
            has not yet been found to qualify open source projects documentation for newcomers, nor have mechanisms been proposed to identify how
            well this documentation meets the needs of newcomers. Note that the term newcomer, in this context, refers to any developer who is aiming 
            to contribute with an open source project.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this experiment, you will be introduced to a set of six categories already defined as important to newcomers in open source projects,
            and your goal is to identify such categories in documentation files for a set of projects.

    MEET THE CATEGORIES

    <div class="meet-the-categories">
        <p>Before identifying any categories in documentation files, it is important to understand in detail the categories
            we would like to identify. In the following list, we describe the six categories proposed for this experiment.
            Read each one carefully.</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <b>CF – Contribution flow:</b>
                    It is not uncommon for newcomers to feel lost and unmotivated when it is not clear how to contribute with an OSS project. For
                    this category, we would like to identify documentation that describes what is the contribution flow of a project. The contribution
                    flow can be defined as a set of steps a newcomer need to follow to develop an acceptable contribution for the project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>CT – Choose a task:</b>
                    Many developers are interested in contributing with OSS projects, but most of them don’t know what task they should start with.
                    In this category, we would like to identify sentences describing how newcomers can find a task to contribute with the project.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>TC – Talk to the community:</b>
                    Besides having a mentor, it is also important for newcomers to get in touch with the project’ community itself. For this reason,
                    we would like to identify any information that describes how a newcomer can get in touch with the community members, including links
                    for communication channels, tutorials on how to send a message, communication etiquette, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>BW – Build local workspace:</b>
                    Newcomers reported in previous studies that they did not find explanations about how they could build their own workspace (build,
                    compile, execute, manage dependencies, etc.) before contributing. We would like to identify sections in documentation that defines
                    the steps on how to build a local workspace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>DC – Deal with the code:</b>
                    Many projects have their own code standards, software architectures and practices. In this category, we would like to identify
                    sections in documentation describing how code should be written, organized and documented.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>SC – Submit the changes:</b>
                    The last step in the contribution process is the submission of  changes. In this category, we would like to identify information
                    about how the change/patch submission should be made.
                </li>
            </ul>
            These categories were defined based on previous experiences reported by newcomers in OSS projects. Your mission in this analysis
            is to identify these six categories for a set of OSS projects. In the following section, we explain how the identification must be done.

        APPLY THE CATEGORIES

        <div class="section-title row">
            <div class="four columns">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="apply-categories">
            <p> Now that you have understood the categories, the second step is to identify the categories in documentation files.
                For this task, we have a set of spreadsheets containing information from CONTRIBUTING files of OSS projects.
                Follow the tutorial below to learn how to analyze each spreadsheet:
            </p>
            <ol type="1" class="list">
                <h5>Identification Tutorial</h5>
                <li>
                    Open a spreadsheet and read carefully each paragraph in the first column.
                </li>
                <img src="img/paragraphs.png" alt="Arrow pointing a paragraph in a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
                <li>
                    If you identify one of the six categories in a paragraph, mark an "x" in the column of the category that you
                    have identified. DO NOT mark an "x" in more than one category per paragraph, always try to identify the most appropriate one.
                </li>
                <img src="img/columns.png" alt="Two arrows pointing the pages of a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
                <li>
                    Save each spreadsheet analyzed in a folder on your computer/cloud. If you find spreadsheets that do not look like documentation files,
                    just move them to a different folder. Do not delete the irrelevant spreadsheets, we might need to explain why they were discarted.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="observations">
                If this is your first time doing this kind of analysis, do not be afraid! Here are a few tips that may help you during the analysis:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Use your perspective as newcomer:</b> There is no specific way to identify the categories.
                        If you have understood the categories correctly, feel free to interpret the paragraphs using your
                        own perspective.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Paragraphs may or may not contain relevant information:</b> Some of the paragraphs may not contain
                        relevant information for newcomers. Make sure you read the paragraphs carefully, and feel free to skip
                        the "irrelevant" ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Restrict your analysis to the spreadsheets:</b> You do not need to open links, subscribe to mailing
                        lists or do something similar during the analysis. Just use the information given to you in the spreadsheets.
                    </li>
