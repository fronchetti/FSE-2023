    <div class="introduction">
    <p>
        Developers, when attempting to contribute to open source projects, often face a set of barriers that compromise the joining process.
        These barriers, in turn, may lead such developers to give up contributing to free software, directly affecting the continuity of
        projects associated with this context.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among the difficulties faced, there are barriers that could be overcome through better documentation for newcomers. However, evidence
        has not yet been found to qualify open source projects documentation for newcomers, nor have mechanisms been proposed to identify how
        well this documentation meets the needs of newcomers. Note that the term newcomer, in this context, refers to any developer who aims 
        to contribute to an open source project.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, you will be introduced to a set of seven categories already defined as important to newcomers in open source projects,
        and your goal is to identify such categories in documentation files for a set of projects. Follow the steps below if you agree to participate
        of this experiment.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p> This is a Software Engineering experiment that aims to identify for Open Source Software (OSS) projects,
        documentation that is relevant for newcomers during their contribution process. In this context, a newcomer can be defined
        as any potential contributor willing to contribute with an OSS project.
    </p>
    <p> We have a set of seven predefined categories known to be important for new contributors, and we would like to ask
        you to find these categories for a set of OSS projects. Follow the steps defined below to participate of the experiment.

    <div class="meet-the-categories">
    <p> Before identifying any categories in documentation files, it is important to understand in detail the categories
        we would like to identify. In the following list, we describe the seven categories proposed for this experiment.
        Read each one carefully. To understand the categories correctly is essential for  the success of this activity.</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
            <b>CF – Contribution flow:</b>
            It is not uncommon for newcomers to feel lost and unmotivated when it is not clear how to contribute with an OSS project. For
            this category, we would like to identify documentation that describes what is the contribution flow of a project. The contribution
            flow can be defined as a set of steps a newcomer need to follow to develop an acceptable contribution for the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>CT – Choose a task:</b>
            Many developers are interested in contributing with OSS projects, but most of them don’t know what task they should start with.
            In this category, we would like to identify sentences describing how newcomers can find a task to contribute with the project.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>FM – Find a mentor:</b>
            In most OSS projects, mentors are assigned to help newcomers during their contribution process. For this category, we would like
            to identify information about how newcomers can find people in the project to act as mentors during their contribution process.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>TC – Talk to the community:</b>
            Besides having a mentor, it is also important for newcomers to get in touch with the project’ community itself. For this reason,
            we would like to identify any information that describes how a newcomer can get in touch with the community members, including links
            for communication channels, tutorials on how to send a message, communication etiquette, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>BW – Build local workspace:</b>
            Newcomers reported in previous studies that they did not find explanations about how they could build their own workspace (build,
            compile, execute, manage dependencies, etc.) before contributing. We would like to identify sections in documentation that defines
            the steps on how to build a local workspace.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>DC – Deal with the code:</b>
            Many projects have their own code standards, software architectures and practices. In this category, we would like to identify
            sections in documentation describing how code should be written, organized and documented.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>SC – Submit the changes:</b>
            The last step in the contribution process is the submission of  changes. In this category, we would like to identify information
            about how the change/patch submission should be made.
        </li>
    </ul>
    These categories were defined based on previous experiences reported by newcomers in OSS projects. Your mission in this experiment
    is to identify these seven categories for a set of OSS projects. In the following section, we explain how the identification must be done.

<div class="section">
    <div class="section-title row">

    </div>
    <div class="apply-categories">
    <p> Now that you have understood the categories, the second step is to identify them in documentation files.
        For this task, we have a set of spreadsheets containing information from documentation files of OSS projects
        (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10fIwpDAajCvnobl7nT6_wk7uTJJa9Xnq?usp=sharing" target="__blank" style="color: red;">Click here to have access</a>)
        You will select five spreadsheets from this set, create your own copy of the spreadsheets you have selected, and try
        to identify the categories for all of them. Note that the spreadsheets are divided in two pages, README and CONTRIBUTING,
        please do not forget to do the identification for both of the pages. A brief tutorial about how the identification should
        be done is defined as follows:
    </p>
    <ol type="1" class="list">
        <h5>Identification Tutorial</h5>
        <li>
            For each spreadsheet you have selected/copied, read carefully the paragraphs in the first column.
        </li>
        <img src="img/paragraphs.png" alt="Arrow pointing a paragraph in a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
        <li>
            If you identify one or more categories in a paragraph, mark an X in the columns of the categories that you
            have identified, respectively.
        </li>
        <img src="img/columns.png" alt="Two arrows pointing X symbols for categories in a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
        <li>
            Repeat the same steps for all the spreadsheets, and do not forget to do the identification for either of the
            two pages in a spreadsheet.
        </li>
        <img src="img/pages.png" alt="Two arrows pointing the pages of a spreadsheet" style="width: 50%;">
        <li>
            Submit the spreadsheets you have classified following the tutorial of the next section.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="observations">
        If this is your first time doing this kind of analysis, do not be afraid! Here are a few tips that may help you during the experiment:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Use your perspective as newcomer:</b> There is no specific way to identify the categories.
                If you have understood the categories correctly, feel free to interpret the paragraphs using your
                own perspective and apply as many categories as you believe for each of them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Paragraphs may or may not contain relevant information:</b> Some of the paragraphs may not contain
                relevant information for newcomers. Make sure you read the  paragraphs carefully, and feel free to skip
                the "irrelevant" ones.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Restrict your analysis to the spreadsheets:</b> You do not need to open links, subscribe to mailing
                lists or do something similar during the analysis. Just use the information given to you in the spreadsheets.
            </li>
        </ul>
