### Introduction
New contributors often face barriers when attempting to contribute to open-source projects.
In this replication package, we explain how we conducted our research using a machine learning
classifier that automatically identifies snippets in documentation files of open source projects
that might be relevant for new contributors.

### Barriers
There are different perspectives in the literature about the barriers that new contributors face in open source
projects. In our study, we were mainly interested in the difficulties that could be mitigated through documentation
files.

### Classifier
#### Extraction of documentation from GitHub
#### Analysis of documentation in spreadsheet format
#### Training of the multiclass classifier
#### Evaluation of the multiclass classifier
