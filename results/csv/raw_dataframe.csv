Our labels,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,34,contributing
"- beginner: One of our most important kinds of issues! These issues have been marked by the maintainers as small, low-impact changes and fixes, ideal for those just dipping their toes for the first time into the world of contributing to Open Source software. These are by no means any less important than any other issues! We'd appreciate if our more experienced contributors would leave these to our newer compatriots so we can be as fair as possible to everyone.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,35,contributing
"- blocked: We will generally mark an issue as blocked if it requires more context for us to fix, is waiting on an updated version of a library that the issue depends on, or is waiting on a maintainer to do something before it can be answered. There may be other conditions in which we'll mark an issue as blocked, and we'll make this clear in the issue comments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,36,contributing
- bug: An issue gets marked as a bug if (surprise!) the issue is linked to a bug in our code or something broken in our infrastructure. Bugs are usually the highest priority kind of issue as they will affect our users.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,37,contributing
"- bugsnag: If an issue or exception in production code has been flagged via Bugsnag, it is labelled with this automatically.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,38,contributing
"- documentation: If an issue requires changes or clarification to our documentation (READMEs, wiki, code comments, etc.) then it will be marked with this issue. These issues normally do not pertain to code changes and are ideal for those who don't necessarily want to get their hands dirty with code.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,39,contributing
"- duplicate: If an issue has been reported before, it will be marked with this label. This flags that a previous issue may not have been fixed as expected, or in the case of things we don't intend to fix or issues currently in discussion in another open issue, it means that we are likely to close the issue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,40,contributing
"- enhancement: These are improvements to the codebase that are ""nice to have"", and are usually medium to high impact but low importance. This includes improvements to features that already exist and may be assigned a milestone to give you an idea as to when it might be implemented. These are great for contributors that might have some extra spare time on their hands and would prefer to change existing code rather than add large chunks of brand new code.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,41,contributing
"- feature: An issue will be marked with this label if it adds a new, discrete functional element to the codebase. They will generally require large amounts or effort to implement, require changes to both front-end view templates and back-end code, and assume prior knowledge of the codebase, making these the most tricky kinds of issues to close. However, they can be the most rewarding to close for the intrepid!",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,42,contributing
- help wanted: Issues will be marked with this label by the maintainers if we'd like outside contributors to pitch in with code or opinions before we close them. These do not assume any skill level and are great opportunities for all members of our community to steer the direction of the project.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,43,contributing
- i18n: Issues related to localisation or translation are marked with these labels. They can range from missing translations for a specific language to grammatical issues and cultural differences. These will usually require a specialist in a non-English language to close.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,44,contributing
"- invalid: These are rare, and normally have been submitted in error.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,45,contributing
"- needs rebase: You will find this label normally attached to pull requests, and means that the maintainers would like to you squash commits or rebase existing commits from master into your branch before we can merge your pull request. A maintainer will clarify this in the comment thread.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,46,contributing
- question: Issues can be marked with this label by anybody who would like other contributors or maintainers to answer a specific question before an issue can be closed. These normally do not assume any skill level (although may sometimes require maintainers to have the final say on them) and are great opportunities for all members of our community to steer the direction of the project.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,47,contributing
"- refactoring: If an issue requires code to be refactored before a particular change can be made, or if you spot inelegant patterns or implementations in code that you feel could be better, then feel free to add this label to an issue. If the issue is the latter type, please be careful about the language you use in these threads. For example, things like ""this code sucks!"" or ""you must be an idiot!"" are unacceptable!. Programmers have feelings too and there are ways to suggest code changes without insulting people!",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,48,contributing
"- security: If you spot an issue related to security issues (e.g. invalid SSL certs, potential CSRF issues), mark it with this label. Don't forget to be a good OSS citizen and always report zero-day issues through a private channel to minimise impact to your fellow users!",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,49,contributing
"- UX: These issues relate to how the site works, or more holistically, how the site feels to the end user, and will normally be related to the front-end of the website. These issues might typically relate to confusion stemming from navigation, form elements, input validation, or breaks in user flows.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,50,contributing
- visual design: This relates to visual elements of the site that could be improved or are broken. This may be as simple as a change to a CSS colour or font size but may stretch all the way to things that do not render as expected on mobile devices. These are usually good issues for people with front-end development experience to tackle.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,51,contributing
"- wontfix: This means that, after considering your issue in full, your issue is outside of the intended scope of the project and is not something we'd like to add to the codebase right now or in the future. These are used sparingly and are intended to be rare, and are never used without reasoned justification.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,52,contributing

backward-incompatible changes to released APIs without also shipping a tool or
process that can upgrade our users' code. We are not yet at the point of easily
releasing such tools. Therefore, at this time, shipping a library establishes an
API contract which is borderline unchangeable. (We can add new functionality,

in such a way that it is independent of the http handling code. The http handling code is called Frontend.
There are currently two Frontends implemented. The first uses the class HttpListener. This implementation
got most attention. The second one uses the Asp.Net infrastructe and the HttpHandles classes. It therefore
could be used in xsp2, mod_mono or even in IIS. But the second implementation was just a proof of concept
and is not tested but should be functional. There exists and Frontend directory which contains all the
Frontend handling code.",1,0,0,0,0,0,alanmcgovern@monotorrent.xlsx,23,contributing

Torrent which should be Announced to the peers. There is currently one Backend implementation which uses

implement the ITorrentManager interface.",1,0,0,0,0,0,alanmcgovern@monotorrent.xlsx,24,contributing

"Howto Test:
If you want to test the Tracker just compile it with MonoDevelop. The Tracker searches (and creates if not
found) for a directory named ./torrents. In this Directory every Torrent is loaded on startup. To test
the Torrent you need some torrents pointing at the Tracker. This can be done with the unit test. Just
run gnunit2 and load the Common.dll in src/bin/Debug. Copy the single.torrent and torrentcreator.torrent
into src/bin/Debug/torrents and start the Tracker in MonoDevelop. Then you can load the Torrents in Azureus
or BitTorrent and check if the Tracker reacts on Announces and Scrapes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,alanmcgovern@monotorrent.xlsx,33,contributing
