Our labels,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,34,contributing
"- beginner: One of our most important kinds of issues! These issues have been marked by the maintainers as small, low-impact changes and fixes, ideal for those just dipping their toes for the first time into the world of contributing to Open Source software. These are by no means any less important than any other issues! We'd appreciate if our more experienced contributors would leave these to our newer compatriots so we can be as fair as possible to everyone.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,35,contributing
"- blocked: We will generally mark an issue as blocked if it requires more context for us to fix, is waiting on an updated version of a library that the issue depends on, or is waiting on a maintainer to do something before it can be answered. There may be other conditions in which we'll mark an issue as blocked, and we'll make this clear in the issue comments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,36,contributing
- bug: An issue gets marked as a bug if (surprise!) the issue is linked to a bug in our code or something broken in our infrastructure. Bugs are usually the highest priority kind of issue as they will affect our users.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,37,contributing
"- bugsnag: If an issue or exception in production code has been flagged via Bugsnag, it is labelled with this automatically.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,38,contributing
"- documentation: If an issue requires changes or clarification to our documentation (READMEs, wiki, code comments, etc.) then it will be marked with this issue. These issues normally do not pertain to code changes and are ideal for those who don't necessarily want to get their hands dirty with code.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,39,contributing
"- duplicate: If an issue has been reported before, it will be marked with this label. This flags that a previous issue may not have been fixed as expected, or in the case of things we don't intend to fix or issues currently in discussion in another open issue, it means that we are likely to close the issue.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,40,contributing
"- enhancement: These are improvements to the codebase that are ""nice to have"", and are usually medium to high impact but low importance. This includes improvements to features that already exist and may be assigned a milestone to give you an idea as to when it might be implemented. These are great for contributors that might have some extra spare time on their hands and would prefer to change existing code rather than add large chunks of brand new code.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,41,contributing
"- feature: An issue will be marked with this label if it adds a new, discrete functional element to the codebase. They will generally require large amounts or effort to implement, require changes to both front-end view templates and back-end code, and assume prior knowledge of the codebase, making these the most tricky kinds of issues to close. However, they can be the most rewarding to close for the intrepid!",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,42,contributing
- help wanted: Issues will be marked with this label by the maintainers if we'd like outside contributors to pitch in with code or opinions before we close them. These do not assume any skill level and are great opportunities for all members of our community to steer the direction of the project.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,43,contributing
- i18n: Issues related to localisation or translation are marked with these labels. They can range from missing translations for a specific language to grammatical issues and cultural differences. These will usually require a specialist in a non-English language to close.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,44,contributing
"- invalid: These are rare, and normally have been submitted in error.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,45,contributing
"- needs rebase: You will find this label normally attached to pull requests, and means that the maintainers would like to you squash commits or rebase existing commits from master into your branch before we can merge your pull request. A maintainer will clarify this in the comment thread.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,46,contributing
- question: Issues can be marked with this label by anybody who would like other contributors or maintainers to answer a specific question before an issue can be closed. These normally do not assume any skill level (although may sometimes require maintainers to have the final say on them) and are great opportunities for all members of our community to steer the direction of the project.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,47,contributing
"- refactoring: If an issue requires code to be refactored before a particular change can be made, or if you spot inelegant patterns or implementations in code that you feel could be better, then feel free to add this label to an issue. If the issue is the latter type, please be careful about the language you use in these threads. For example, things like ""this code sucks!"" or ""you must be an idiot!"" are unacceptable!. Programmers have feelings too and there are ways to suggest code changes without insulting people!",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,48,contributing
"- security: If you spot an issue related to security issues (e.g. invalid SSL certs, potential CSRF issues), mark it with this label. Don't forget to be a good OSS citizen and always report zero-day issues through a private channel to minimise impact to your fellow users!",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,49,contributing
"- UX: These issues relate to how the site works, or more holistically, how the site feels to the end user, and will normally be related to the front-end of the website. These issues might typically relate to confusion stemming from navigation, form elements, input validation, or breaks in user flows.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,50,contributing
- visual design: This relates to visual elements of the site that could be improved or are broken. This may be as simple as a change to a CSS colour or font size but may stretch all the way to things that do not render as expected on mobile devices. These are usually good issues for people with front-end development experience to tackle.,0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,51,contributing
"- wontfix: This means that, after considering your issue in full, your issue is outside of the intended scope of the project and is not something we'd like to add to the codebase right now or in the future. These are used sparingly and are intended to be rare, and are never used without reasoned justification.",0,1,0,0,0,0,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,52,contributing

releasing such tools. Therefore, at this time, shipping a library establishes an

in such a way that it is independent of the http handling code. The http handling code is called Frontend.
There are currently two Frontends implemented. The first uses the class HttpListener. This implementation
got most attention. The second one uses the Asp.Net infrastructe and the HttpHandles classes. It therefore
could be used in xsp2, mod_mono or even in IIS. But the second implementation was just a proof of concept
and is not tested but should be functional. There exists and Frontend directory which contains all the
Frontend handling code.",1,0,0,0,0,0,alanmcgovern@monotorrent.xlsx,23,contributing

Torrent which should be Announced to the peers. There is currently one Backend implementation which uses

implement the ITorrentManager interface.",1,0,0,0,0,0,alanmcgovern@monotorrent.xlsx,24,contributing

"Howto Test:
If you want to test the Tracker just compile it with MonoDevelop. The Tracker searches (and creates if not
found) for a directory named ./torrents. In this Directory every Torrent is loaded on startup. To test
the Torrent you need some torrents pointing at the Tracker. This can be done with the unit test. Just
run gnunit2 and load the Common.dll in src/bin/Debug. Copy the single.torrent and torrentcreator.torrent
into src/bin/Debug/torrents and start the Tracker in MonoDevelop. Then you can load the Torrents in Azureus
or BitTorrent and check if the Tracker reacts on Announces and Scrapes.",0,0,0,0,0,1,alanmcgovern@monotorrent.xlsx,33,contributing

Chart parameters are stored as a JSON encoded string the slices.params column and are often referenced throughout the code as form-data. Currently the form-data is neither versioned nor typed as thus is somewhat free-formed. Note in the future there may be merit in using something like JSON Schema to both annotate and validate the JSON object in addition to using a Mypy TypedDict (introduced in Python 3.8) for typing the form-data in the backend. This section serves as a potential primer for that work.,0,0,0,0,0,0,apache@incubator-superset.xlsx,397,contributing
The following tables provide a non-exhausive list of the various fields which can be present in the JSON object grouped by the Explorer pane sections.

Note not all fields are correctly catagorized. The fields vary based on visualization type and may apprear in different sections depending on the type.

It is important that you create a new branch to make changes on and that you do not change the master branch (other than to rebase in changes from upstream/master).  In this example I will assume you will be making your changes to a branch called feature_x.  This feature_x branch will be created on your local repository and will be pushed to your forked repository on GitHub.  Once this branch is on your fork you will create a Pull Request for the changes to be added to the Apache Shiro project.,0,0,0,0,0,1,apache@shiro.xlsx,12,contributing

It is important that you maintain an up-to-date master branch in your local repository.  This is done by rebasing in the code changes from upstream/master (the official Apache Shiro project repository) into your local repository.

"The project aims to minimise the impact on users upgrading to newer versions of the library and it should not be necessary for a user to make any changes to their own code to work with a newer version of the library. Unless the user has made an active decision to use newer features, a newer generation of the library or a change has been necessary due to a security issue or other significant software defect, no modifications to their own code should be necessary. To achieve this, API compatibility is maintained between different versions of Mbed TLS on the main development branch and in LTS (Long Term Support) branches.",0,0,0,0,0,0,ARMmbed@mbedtls.xlsx,20,contributing

"Where changes to an existing interface are necessary, functions in the public interface which need to be changed, are marked as 'deprecated'.

"Therefore, no changes are permitted to the definition of functions in the public interface which will change the API. Instead the interface can only be changed by its extension.

AWS Amplify aims to enhance the development experience using JavaScript with AWS. Amplify codifies best practices through programmatic interfaces to help you effortlessly interact with cloud resources.,0,0,0,0,0,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,19,contributing

"Opinionated implementations: There are many ways to interface with AWS Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others. For instance, if sending and receiving JSON, we would prefer an API Gateway endpoint to other mechanisms. Amplify will programmatically help optimize for cost and performance through library decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,21,contributing
Declarative actions: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client object and the ability to perform common actions.,0,0,0,0,0,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,22,contributing
"Cascading service interactions: Certain actions in a declarative style can have overlapping or ambiguous AWS Service implementations.

For instance, sending an image will prefer S3 over API Gateway.",0,0,0,0,0,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,23,contributing
"Simple, standard data objects: Sending & receiving data to AWS Services can have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys, etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow focus on state and data types only.",0,0,0,0,0,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,24,contributing

"As more and more modules were introduced to AWS Amplify, it became necessary to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward-compatible to avoid breaking changes.",0,0,0,0,1,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,26,contributing

"Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.",0,0,0,0,1,0,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,28,contributing

Client Libraries are sdks used to interact with azure resources at application run time while Management Libraries are those used to manage (create/modify/delete) Azure resources.,0,0,0,0,0,0,Azure@azure-sdk-for-net.xlsx,12,contributing
Build Repo : To build all Client and Management libraries together. Invoke dotnet build build.proj from the root of the repo.To scope to a single service supply a scope property e.g. dotnet build build.proj /p:Scope=servicebus.

"Path Length : To account for the 260 characters Path Length Limit encountered on windows OS, file paths within the repo is keep below 210 characters.

How it works,0,0,0,0,0,0,Azure@azure-sdk-for-net.xlsx,118,contributing
"We use a dummy project called ApiCompat to enforce API compatibility between the GA'ed libraries and the most recent version available on Nuget. This project includes package references to the GA'ed library and to Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.
Each library needs to provide a ApiCompatVersion property which is set to the last GA'ed version of the library which is used to compare APIs with the current to ensure no breaks
have been introduced.
The ApiCompatVerification target defined in ApiCompat.csproj is referenced in the eng/Directory.Build.Data.targets which causes this target to be executed for each csproj that has the ApiCompatVersion property set. For libraries that wish to disable the APICompat check they can remove the ApiCompatVersion property from their project. Our version bump automation will automatically add or increment the ApiCompatVersion property to the project when it detects that the version it is changing was a GA version which usually indicates that we just shipped that GA version and so it should be the new baseline for api checks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,Azure@azure-sdk-for-net.xlsx,119,contributing

Note about Semantic Versioning and breaking changes,0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,43,contributing
"As a developer, you must understand every change is a breaking change. What is a bug for someone
is expected in someone else's workflow. The consequence of a change strongly depends on the usage.
Semantic Versioning relies to public API. In PHP, the public API of a class is its public
methods. However, if you extend a class, you can access protected methods, then if you use reflexion, you can
access private methods. So anything can become a public API if you force it to be. That doesn't mean we should handle
any possible usage, else we would have to publish a major release for each change and it would no longer make sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,44,contributing
"So before any complain about a breaking change, be warned, we do not guarantee a strict Semantic Versioning as you
may expect, we're following a pragmatic interpretation of Semantic Versioning that allows the software to evolve in a
reliable way with reasonable maintenance effort.",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,45,contributing
"Concretely, we consider a change as breaking if it makes fail one of our unit test. We will do our best to avoid
incompatibilities with libraries that extends Carbon classes (such as Laravel that is continuously tested thanks to
Travis CI, see the compatibility matrix).",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,46,contributing
"If you're the owner of a library that strongly depends on Carbon, we recommend you to run unit tests daily requiring
""nesbot/carbon"": ""dev-master"" (for ^2) or ""nesbot/carbon"": ""dev-version-1.next"" (for ^1), this way you can
detect incompatibilities earlier and report it to us before we tag a release. We'll pay attention and try to fix it to
make update to next minor releases as soft as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,47,contributing
"We reserve the right to publish emergency patches within 24 hours after a release if a tag that does not respect
this pattern would have been released despite our vigilance. In this very rare and particular case, we would mark the
tag as broken on GitHub and backward compatibility would be based on previous stable tag.",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,48,contributing
"Last, you must understand that Carbon extends PHP natives classes, that means Carbon can be impacted by any change
that occurs in the date/time API of PHP. We watch new PHP versions and handle those changes as quickly as possible
when detected, but as PHP does not follow the semantic versioning pattern, it basically means any releases (including
patches) can have unexpected consequences on Carbon methods results.",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,49,contributing
Long term support,0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,50,contributing
"To benefit the better support, require Carbon using major version range (^1 or ^2). By requiring 1.26.*,
~1.26.0 or limited range such as >=1.20 <1.33, you fall to low priority support (only security and critical issues
will be fixed), our prior support goes to next minor releases of each major version. It applies to bug fixes and
low-cost features. Other new features will only be added in the last stable release. At the opposite, we recommend you
to restrain to a major number, as there is no compatibility guarantee from a major version to the next. It means
requiring >=2, as it allows any newer version, will probably leads to errors on releasing our next major version.",0,0,0,0,0,0,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,51,contributing
