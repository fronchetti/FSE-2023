"The goal is to make the common use-cases exposed via simple controls on UI while allowing further customizations to be done through hooks and scripts. If a new feature is doable via the existing features, or a basic tool, do not add it to CapRover. We do not want to bloat this application. One example is: ""Add a flag to customize the placement constraints of containers"". This is definitely doable in Docker, but we don't want to mirror every single functionality of Docker to CapRover. If we do that, CapRover becomes a very hard to maintain project. Instead we should add customization hooks for these advanced and rare use cases. For example, instead of mirroring every single nginx config, we added the ability of customizing the nginx config for advanced users.- Last but not least AVOID LARGE PULL REQUESTS at all cost as they won't get reviewed unless they are discussed in the Slack channel beforehand.",No categories identified.

"The Tracker is a piece of Software which listens for HttpRequests. Each Request can either be an Announce

in such a way that it is independent of the http handling code. The http handling code is called Frontend.
There are currently two Frontends implemented. The first uses the class HttpListener. This implementation
got most attention. The second one uses the Asp.Net infrastructe and the HttpHandles classes. It therefore
could be used in xsp2, mod_mono or even in IIS. But the second implementation was just a proof of concept
and is not tested but should be functional. There exists and Frontend directory which contains all the
Frontend handling code.",CF – Contribution flow

"Mike Perham's Kill Your Dependencies
notes that, ""every dependency in your application has the potential to
bloat your app, to destabilize your app, to inject odd behavior...
When you are considering adding a dependency to your Rails app,
it's a good idea to do a quick sanity check..."".
So don't bring in gems you don't need
(if it's trivial to re-implement the required function, consider doing it).
Also, if the gem transitively depends on in many other gems,
especially if they are new additions, look for simpler alternatives
or help the upstream library remove the unnecessary dependencies.",No categories identified.
