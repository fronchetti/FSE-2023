"We have a number of conventions around variable naming that are still being

Vocab vocab and Language nlp. You should avoid naming variables that are
of other types these names. For instance, don't name a text string doc
should usually call this text. Two general code style preferences further help
with naming. First, lean away from introducing temporary variables, as these
clutter your namespace. This is one reason why comprehension expressions are
often preferred. Second, keep your functions shortish, so they can work in a
smaller scope. Of course, this is a question of trade-offs.",DC – Deal with the code,https://github.com/explosion/spaCy

"- What would this feature look like if implemented in a separate package?
Some features would be very difficult to implement externally
changes to spaCy's built-in methods. In contrast, a library of word
alignment functions could easily live as a separate package that depended on
spaCy import word_aligner and
import spacy.word_aligner. spaCy v2.0+ makes it easy to implement
custom pipeline components,
and add your own attributes, properties and methods to the Doc, Token and
Span. If you're looking to implement a new spaCy feature, starting with a
custom component package is usually the best strategy. You won't have to worry
about spaCy's internals and you can test your module in an isolated
environment. And if it works well, we can always integrate it into the core
library later.",DC – Deal with the code,https://github.com/explosion/spaCy

"Finally, if you're new to Cython, you should expect to find the first steps a
bit frustrating. It's a very large language, since it's essentially a superset
of Python and C++, with additional complexity and syntax from numpy. The
documentation isn't great, and there are
many ""traps for new players"". Working in Cython is very rewarding once you're
over the initial learning curve. As with C and C++, the first way you write
something in Cython will often be the performance-optimal approach. In contrast,
Python optimisation generally requires a lot of experimentation. Is it faster to
have an if item in my_dict check, or to use .get()? What about try/except?
Does this numpy operation create a copy? There's no way to guess the answers to
these questions, and you'll usually be dissatisfied with your results
there's no way to know when to stop this process. In the worst case, you'll make
a mess that invites the next reader to try their luck too. This is like one of
those volcanic gas-traps,
where the rescuers keep passing out from low oxygen, causing another rescuer to
follow
Python. If it's not fast enough the first time, just switch to Cython.",CF – Contribution flow,https://github.com/explosion/spaCy

"- Is the feature orthogonal to the current spaCy functionality, or overlapping?
spaCy strongly prefers to avoid having 6 different ways of doing the same thing.
As better techniques are developed, we prefer to drop support for ""the old way"".
However, it's rare that one approach entirely dominates another. It's very
common that there's still a use-case for the ""obsolete"" approach. For instance,
WordNet is still very useful
vectors are better for most use-cases, and the two approaches to lexical
semantics do a lot of the same things. spaCy therefore only supports word
vectors, and support for WordNet is currently left for other packages.",DC – Deal with the code,https://github.com/explosion/spaCy

you to allocate memory which will be freed when the Pool object is garbage
collected. This means you usually don't have to worry about freeing memory. You
just have to decide which Python object owns the memory, and make it own the
Pool. When that object goes out of scope, the memory will be freed. You do
have to take care that no pointers outlive the object that owns them
