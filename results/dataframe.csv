"- beginner: One of our most important kinds of issues! These issues have been marked by the maintainers as small, low-impact changes and fixes, ideal for those just dipping their toes for the first time into the world of contributing to Open Source software. These are by no means any less important than any other issues!

There may be other conditions in which we'll mark an issue as blocked, and we'll make this clear in the issue comments.",0,1,0,0,0,0,CT – Choose a task,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,contributing,34

"- enhancement: These are improvements to the codebase that are ""nice to have"", and are usually medium to high impact but low importance. This includes improvements to features that already exist and may be assigned a milestone to give you an idea as to when it might be implemented. These are great for contributors that might have some extra spare time on their hands and would prefer to change existing code rather than add large chunks of brand new code.",0,1,0,0,0,0,CT – Choose a task,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,contributing,39
"- feature: An issue will be marked with this label if it adds a new, discrete functional element to the codebase. They will generally require large amounts or effort to implement, require changes to both front-end view templates and back-end code, and assume prior knowledge of the codebase, making these the most tricky kinds of issues to close. However, they can be the most rewarding to close for the intrepid!",0,1,0,0,0,0,CT – Choose a task,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,contributing,40

A maintainer will clarify this in the comment thread.",0,1,0,0,0,0,CT – Choose a task,24pullrequests@24pullrequests.xlsx,contributing,44

"- refactoring: If an issue requires code to be refactored before a particular change can be made, or if you spot inelegant patterns or implementations in code that you feel could be better, then feel free to add this label to an issue. If the issue is the latter type, please be careful about the language you use in these threads. For example, things like ""this code sucks!"" or ""you must be an idiot!"" are unacceptable!.

"- UX: These issues relate to how the site works, or more holistically, how the site feels to the end user, and will normally be related to the front-end of the website.

- visual design: This relates to visual elements of the site that could be improved or are broken.

to consider a library for inclusion in Abseil, it is not enough that a library
is useful. We generally choose to release a library when it meets at least one
of the following criteria:",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,abseil@abseil-cpp.xlsx,contributing,9

"- Anticipated widespread usage - Pre-adoption of some standard-compliant
APIs may not have broad adoption initially but can be expected to pick up
usage when it replaces legacy APIs. absl::from_chars, for example,
replaces existing code that converts strings to numbers and will therefore
likely see usage growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,abseil@abseil-cpp.xlsx,contributing,11

and are released because of their importance.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,abseil@abseil-cpp.xlsx,contributing,12
"- Direct support for a library that falls under one of the above - When we
want access to a smaller library as an implementation detail for a
higher-priority library we plan to release, we may release it, as we did
with portions of absl/meta/type_traits.h. One consequence of this is that

releasing such tools. Therefore, at this time, shipping a library establishes an
API contract which is borderline unchangeable. (We can add new functionality,

got most attention. The second one uses the Asp.Net infrastructe and the HttpHandles classes. It therefore

If you want to test the Tracker just compile it with MonoDevelop. The Tracker searches (and creates if not
found) for a directory named ./torrents. In this Directory every Torrent is loaded on startup. To test
the Torrent you need some torrents pointing at the Tracker. This can be done with the unit test. Just
run gnunit2 and load the Common.dll in src/bin/Debug. Copy the single.torrent and torrentcreator.torrent
into src/bin/Debug/torrents and start the Tracker in MonoDevelop. Then you can load the Torrents in Azureus

Chart Parameters,0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,apache@incubator-superset.xlsx,contributing,394
Chart parameters are stored as a JSON encoded string the slices.params column and are often referenced throughout the code as form-data. Currently the form-data is neither versioned nor typed as thus is somewhat free-formed. Note in the future there may be merit in using something like JSON Schema to both annotate and validate the JSON object in addition to using a Mypy TypedDict (introduced in Python 3.8) for typing the form-data in the backend. This section serves as a potential primer for that work.,0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,apache@incubator-superset.xlsx,contributing,395
The following tables provide a non-exhausive list of the various fields which can be present in the JSON object grouped by the Explorer pane sections. These values were obtained by extracting the distinct fields from a legacy deployment consisting of tens of thousands of charts and thus some fields may be missing whilst others may be deprecated.,0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,apache@incubator-superset.xlsx,contributing,396
Note not all fields are correctly catagorized. The fields vary based on visualization type and may apprear in different sections depending on the type. Verified deprecated columns may indicate a missing migration and/or prior migrations which were unsucessful and thus future work may be required to clean up the form-data.,0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,apache@incubator-superset.xlsx,contributing,397

It is important that you create a new branch to make changes on and that you do not change the master branch (other than to rebase in changes from upstream/master).  In this example I will assume you will be making your changes to a branch called feature_x.  This feature_x branch will be created on your local repository and will be pushed to your forked repository on GitHub.  Once this branch is on your fork you will create a Pull Request for the changes to be added to the Apache Shiro project.,0,0,0,0,0,1,SC – Submit the changes,apache@shiro.xlsx,contributing,10

"Opinionated implementations: There are many ways to interface with AWS Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others.

"Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.",0,0,0,0,1,0,DC – Deal with the code,aws-amplify@amplify-js.xlsx,contributing,26

"We use a dummy project called ApiCompat to enforce API compatibility between the GA'ed libraries and the most recent version available on Nuget. This project includes package references to the GA'ed library and to Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.
Each library needs to provide a ApiCompatVersion property which is set to the last GA'ed version of the library which is used to compare APIs with the current to ensure no breaks
have been introduced.
The ApiCompatVerification target defined in ApiCompat.csproj is referenced in the eng/Directory.Build.Data.targets which causes this target to be executed for each csproj that has the ApiCompatVersion property set. For libraries that wish to disable the APICompat check they can remove the ApiCompatVersion property from their project. Our version bump automation will automatically add or increment the ApiCompatVersion property to the project when it detects that the version it is changing was a GA version which usually indicates that we just shipped that GA version and so it should be the new baseline for api checks.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,Azure@azure-sdk-for-net.xlsx,contributing,117

"As a developer, you must understand every change is a breaking change. What is a bug for someone
is expected in someone else's workflow. The consequence of a change strongly depends on the usage.
Semantic Versioning relies to public API. In PHP, the public API of a class is its public
methods. However, if you extend a class, you can access protected methods, then if you use reflexion, you can
access private methods. So anything can become a public API if you force it to be. That doesn't mean we should handle
any possible usage, else we would have to publish a major release for each change and it would no longer make sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,42
"So before any complain about a breaking change, be warned, we do not guarantee a strict Semantic Versioning as you
may expect, we're following a pragmatic interpretation of Semantic Versioning that allows the software to evolve in a
reliable way with reasonable maintenance effort.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,43
"Concretely, we consider a change as breaking if it makes fail one of our unit test. We will do our best to avoid
incompatibilities with libraries that extends Carbon classes (such as Laravel that is continuously tested thanks to
Travis CI, see the compatibility matrix).",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,44
"If you're the owner of a library that strongly depends on Carbon, we recommend you to run unit tests daily requiring
""nesbot/carbon"": ""dev-master"" (for ^2) or ""nesbot/carbon"": ""dev-version-1.next"" (for ^1), this way you can
detect incompatibilities earlier and report it to us before we tag a release. We'll pay attention and try to fix it to
make update to next minor releases as soft as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,45
"We reserve the right to publish emergency patches within 24 hours after a release if a tag that does not respect
this pattern would have been released despite our vigilance. In this very rare and particular case, we would mark the
tag as broken on GitHub and backward compatibility would be based on previous stable tag.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,46
"Last, you must understand that Carbon extends PHP natives classes, that means Carbon can be impacted by any change
that occurs in the date/time API of PHP. We watch new PHP versions and handle those changes as quickly as possible
when detected, but as PHP does not follow the semantic versioning pattern, it basically means any releases (including
patches) can have unexpected consequences on Carbon methods results.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,47
Long term support,0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,48
"To benefit the better support, require Carbon using major version range (^1 or ^2). By requiring 1.26.*,
~1.26.0 or limited range such as >=1.20 <1.33, you fall to low priority support (only security and critical issues
will be fixed), our prior support goes to next minor releases of each major version. It applies to bug fixes and
low-cost features. Other new features will only be added in the last stable release. At the opposite, we recommend you
to restrain to a major number, as there is no compatibility guarantee from a major version to the next. It means
requiring >=2, as it allows any newer version, will probably leads to errors on releasing our next major version.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,briannesbitt@Carbon.xlsx,contributing,49

"Since the birth of CapRover, there has been many contributions and suggestions that shaped CapRover as we know it today. One of the very important factor in the contribution you make is to stick with CapRover design philosophy.- CapRover is not an enterprise grade application like Kubernetes. Do not patch it with half-done features that make it look like one - it will eventually fail as we don't have resources to support such features.- CapRover scope is a helper around Docker, nginx and Let's Encrypt.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,caprover@caprover.xlsx,contributing,4
"The goal is to make the common use-cases exposed via simple controls on UI while allowing further customizations to be done through hooks and scripts. If a new feature is doable via the existing features, or a basic tool, do not add it to CapRover. We do not want to bloat this application. One example is: ""Add a flag to customize the placement constraints of containers"". This is definitely doable in Docker, but we don't want to mirror every single functionality of Docker to CapRover. If we do that, CapRover becomes a very hard to maintain project. Instead we should add customization hooks for these advanced and rare use cases. For example, instead of mirroring every single nginx config, we added the ability of customizing the nginx config for advanced users.- Last but not least AVOID LARGE PULL REQUESTS at all cost as they won't get reviewed unless they are discussed in the Slack channel beforehand.",0,0,0,0,0,0,No categories identified.,caprover@caprover.xlsx,contributing,5

<staging>/daemon-base/ and <staging>/daemon/ image directories. Additionally, developers can
inspect a staging directory's files to view exactly what will be (or has been) built into the
container images. Additionally, in order to maintain a core source base that is as reusable as
possible for all flavors, staging also supports a very basic form of templating. Some tooling has

emergency security patch) can be applied to the ""master"" branch to create a new version, without worrying
about other features holding it up. For this reason, all commits need to be made to the ""develop"" branch,

newlines in paragraph-like content are considered as real line breaks;
