"Amplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.",DC – Deal with the code

We periodically ""sync"" translation.io with the development version of the
badge application using the command rake translation:sync.
Sync'ing loads the updated English text config/locales/en.yml

and also copies the translations in the translation.io website
into the badge application directory config/locales/.
When this updated version of the badge application is later
put into production, the updated translations are used.
This makes it very easy for translators to translate text.
Note that there are intermediate steps between the updating a translation

overridden for certain flavors. For example, the src/daemon/__DAEMON_PACKAGES__ file defines the
daemon packages which should be installed in the base image. A distro is not required to install
these packages via its package manager or to use this list (though it is recommended to gain as much

"Howto Test:
If you want to test the Tracker just compile it with MonoDevelop. The Tracker searches (and creates if not
found) for a directory named ./torrents. In this Directory every Torrent is loaded on startup. To test
the Torrent you need some torrents pointing at the Tracker. This can be done with the unit test. Just
run gnunit2 and load the Common.dll in src/bin/Debug. Copy the single.torrent and torrentcreator.torrent
into src/bin/Debug/torrents and start the Tracker in MonoDevelop. Then you can load the Torrents in Azureus
or BitTorrent and check if the Tracker reacts on Announces and Scrapes.",SC – Submit the changes

methods. However, if you extend a class, you can access protected methods, then if you use reflexion, you can
access private methods. So anything can become a public API if you force it to be. That doesn't mean we should handle
any possible usage, else we would have to publish a major release for each change and it would no longer make sense.",No categories identified.

"Do not modify a String literal in-place

There are current plans that
Ruby 3's string literals will be immutable.
See issue 11473 for more.
Even if this doesn't happen, freezing string literals is both faster and

Use ""dup"" on a string literal to produce a mutable string;

this provides a simple backwards-compatible way for us to indicate

"In Ruby,
prefer symbols over strings (especially as hash keys)
when they do not potentially come from the user.
Symbols are typically faster, with no loss of readability.

Data from JSON should normally be accessed with strings,
since that's how Ruby normally reads it.
Rails normally uses the type ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess,
where the difference between symbols and strings is ignored,

Chart parameters are stored as a JSON encoded string the slices.params column and are often referenced throughout the code as form-data. Currently the form-data is neither versioned nor typed as thus is somewhat free-formed. Note in the future there may be merit in using something like JSON Schema to both annotate and validate the JSON object in addition to using a Mypy TypedDict (introduced in Python 3.8) for typing the form-data in the backend. This section serves as a potential primer for that work.,No categories identified.

"We use a dummy project called ApiCompat to enforce API compatibility between the GA'ed libraries and the most recent version available on Nuget. This project includes package references to the GA'ed library and to Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.
Each library needs to provide a ApiCompatVersion property which is set to the last GA'ed version of the library which is used to compare APIs with the current to ensure no breaks
have been introduced.
The ApiCompatVerification target defined in ApiCompat.csproj is referenced in the eng/Directory.Build.Data.targets which causes this target to be executed for each csproj that has the ApiCompatVersion property set. For libraries that wish to disable the APICompat check they can remove the ApiCompatVersion property from their project. Our version bump automation will automatically add or increment the ApiCompatVersion property to the project when it detects that the version it is changing was a GA version which usually indicates that we just shipped that GA version and so it should be the new baseline for api checks.",No categories identified.

"It's important to try to stay relatively up to date.
However, it's usually not possible to keep
everything perfectly up-to-date, because
different gems' specifications forbid it.
Also, the Ruby ecosystem is fairly fast-moving,
so it doesn't take long at all for even a direct dependency to go out of date.
In short, it's normal to have some gems that are not the latest.
The key is to replace gem versions that have security vulnerabilities,
and to not get too far behind, because if it's too far back then it's
harder to update.
If you are very far behind, it may be better to update in stages
(using intermediate versions), but avoid needing to do that.",DC – Deal with the code

"The src/ directory contains the core code that is applicable for all flavors -- all Ceph versions

includes the ceph-container-specific code that is built into the container images as well as build
configuration files. src/ should be viewed as the base set of functionality all flavors must
implement. To maximize reuse and keep the core source base in one place, care should be taken to try
to make the core source applicable to all flavors whenever possible. Note the existence of the
""CEPH_VERSION"" environment variable (and other similar variables) built into the containers.
ceph-container source code can use container environment variables to execute code paths

"To benefit the better support, require Carbon using major version range (^1 or ^2). By requiring 1.26.*,
~1.26.0 or limited range such as >=1.20 <1.33, you fall to low priority support (only security and critical issues
will be fixed), our prior support goes to next minor releases of each major version. It applies to bug fixes and
low-cost features. Other new features will only be added in the last stable release. At the opposite, we recommend you
to restrain to a major number, as there is no compatibility guarantee from a major version to the next. It means
requiring >=2, as it allows any newer version, will probably leads to errors on releasing our next major version.",No categories identified.
