# Qualification
In a first attempt to provide substantial data for the machine learning
classifiers, the authors of this study asked undergraduate students 
from two universities in Brazil to analyze OSS projects spreadsheets.
However, the spreadsheets analyzed during this first attempt were not
significant enough to result in a good classification performance.

Considering the time and availability constraints to analyze more data, 
the authors decided to change the strategy of analysis. At the end,
two authors analyzed the spreadsheets that you may find in the data folder. 
None of the worksheets analyzed by the students were used, although they are
publicly available in this folder for clarity.
